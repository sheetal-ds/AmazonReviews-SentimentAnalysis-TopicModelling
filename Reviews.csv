1 rating for flipkart old laptop exchange handling and for their customer care cutting the calls and marking the issue as resolved multiple times without trying to solve it the design of this laptop is flimsy it has a plastic body and this body is a fingerprint magnet the hinge is not that strong and from a table fans air also the screen vibrates feels like a bad purchase should have spent 1015k more and got the hp omen

battery backup issue
everything is good in laptop but one bad part is whenever u give little vibration or shake the whole display start moving installation work is super fast display clearity is superb quite heavy but awesome
battery issue only even though u use it in low configuration still battery lasts for 15 hrsif u can compromise with battery then it will be best in this range
was using a simple platform to learn python coding and the device froze the device is absolutely new and i wasnt even multitasking also the speakers of this device fall on the negative sideapart from that laptop seems fine for now
cons low brightnesslow sound as compared to asus tuf 15 inchprosprice 4825017 inch
its ok but not good experience
build quality is very poor and low quality plastic is usedtrack pad is average and difficult to handle need to use a separate mouse insteadbattery drains very fast so without power plugin not recommended to useheating too much in small tasks also plastic build may get damaged because of this heatnot useful for every day
ok but
battery backup was soo soo sooo worst and its draining very fast this laptop always use with plugin socket and sometimes i feel whether i purchased laptop or desktop display also having very low brightness performance was average overall it is a not bad and not good product i think realme laptops are more better than this laptop

the biggest issue is with the design of the laptop itselfhot air out issueheat flow is directly on the screen which is going to have a bad impact soon enoughduring heavy graphics works like gaming and stuff the laptop heats a lot and releases very hot air directly on the screen and the temperature on that area of screen goes very highkeyboard design issuekeyboard layout is not good toonumpad is just adjusted there looks like it doesnt belong in therepower button is simil
its good laptop but price of laptop is to much in market same price range many others laptop available with more ram and ssd its features are very good it give you good pleasure during running time they should give more ram than present ram 
if u want to buy a laptop based on editinggaming i suggest is to please avoid thisall because of its display tft lcd display you cant experience the good quality picturei agree in processor and gpu you can use it for codingalso run smooth gaming but picture not so goodok ok

everything is good but not too good heating issue loud fan sound battery fast drain outpremium light weight laptopbut comes with windows 11 home single language which is windows 10 version 2009base speed of prosser 17 which is not mentioned in any description
overall not recommended for heavy users the cons over pros are heats a lot even in normal usage the gen 4 ssd provided is way slower than my samsung evo plus frequent bluetooth issues heard same from other acer users within a month keys started giving issues bad quality web cam
prosexcellent in the market in terms of cofigurationlike graphics cardprocessorthunderbolt portvalue for money consbuild quality is avreageonly 3 usb ports are availwhen window defender is run antivirus uses 100 cpu utilizationif you run multiple software at a time 8gm memory is nort sufficient
nice processor but not for gaming works fine most of the time waiting for its warranty to expire so that i could uninstall windows and install linux
worst experience i have ever had
build quality is good screen processor every thing is fine but battery charger is completing very fast hardly 90min battery is getting completed
battery backup is very poor maximum back up 225 hr and sound is also very poor performance are good enough
this laptop is not gamming laptop this is support any small graphics game
everything thing is good except sound quality and loudness is very low
laptop box seal was not proper and it was not sticked properly looks like opened and the same i informed to the delivery guyhowever till now no issue observe actually not used properlyi will update for any observation
it is a gaming laptop but its battery backup is only 3 to 4 hour which is less and i think so this is only a problem which i feel overall it is good laptop for this value this experience i share with you when i used it a month 
battery backup is very poorkeep that in mind before buying
battery will drain fast and i am facing some lag issues
i am using 4 month ssd replaced and so many problems on this laptopvirus catch laptop

its ok type bought at decent deal during big billion days its the first day of usage will post the final review after some days battery back up very poor will need to update the ram otherwise the game is choppy build quality is plastic but its good display is ok type we can overclock the performance manually
worst packaging almost shocking to see laptoo came with noprotection is was jst wrotten laptop box and laptop inside default foam pading aaved the laptop i guess no second box or padding to save the laptop laptop is good though
product is overall super but battery life disappointed
battery was not upto the mark facing error while running some aaa games some update not installing properly best value for money if price drops under 60k
laptop is good in overall performance but build quality is not satisfactory and volume is so low u r not able to listen audio without speaker but cemra is so good compare to other laptop in same price rangeu can go through it if u havent issue regarding speaker and build qualityits performance is osmi love it
everything is fine except battery backup on normal usage without wifi can be used for 2hr 45 min not more than that i expected atleast 4hr considering its a 7nm u series processor and a 48whr battery a bit disappointedperformance is great i dont play games but video editing and photoshop works smoothly without any lag or heat heat management is pretty goodi think the hinge wont be durable after 2yrs or so sometimes a cracking sound can be heard if heard closelyoverall i
this laptop is very slow hai if you are a graphic designer and want to take it for designing then it is not for you at all it shows not responding many times while photoshop is open and if you work on any software like illustrator if yes then this system is not for you at all and for gaming it is neither very good even if you look at it but it is also good in some things like display is very good sound and design is also very good boot time also 10 15 sec there is more according to me 
the top design at the end is lower than the displaymonitor lid thus when you put inside a tight bag it will put pressure on the display lid rather than the hipwhere aspire is writtenyour display will get catches from the keyboard when you put anything other than laptop in the backpack coz the lid is so weak this is very disappointingbattery backup is very bad even if you are not using graphics it will be drained within 23 hrs and if you do graphic related work then it will be dra

colors and display not up to the mark not looks like an iosdisplay
display was not good
was using a simple platform to learn python coding and the device froze the device is absolutely new and i wasnt even multitasking also the speakers of this device fall on the negative sideapart from that laptop seems fine for now
cons low brightnesslow sound as compared to asus tuf 15 inchprosprice 4825017 inch
its ok but not good experience
3 main issues with the laptop regarding quality1 keyboard is too soft and not tactile unlike rog2 webcam is just 1mp and really worst quality3 laptop build isnt as expected its just too cheap plastic design could have made it better compared to t430 i love t430 more
every thing is good but my screen is beating up
main plus point is the display and the backlit keyboard faced issue in flickering microphone and speaker not working after 5 days as an online teacher both are very essential for me have requested for replacement hope i will get a good product for the amount i purchasededit i did a factory reset and the laptop is working fine now but the customer service of asus is pathetic
sound and battery life utterly disappoints you
screen is flickering sometimes not happy with the display
sound to much low compared to other brand laptop s
all good but battery backup not good enough
good products bt battery is not good
awsome at everything tho havent tried any gamesbut without games awesomeoh ya the speaker is not that powerful but it gives its best
review after 2day used camera quality not goodspeaker also not very goodotherwise good product under this price segment fast speed
it is so much heating but performance is ok very low sound and design is looking good
good but speaker not loud
overall good productbut battery quality verry bad and sound system volume no loud
battery only last 2 hours i bought it on august and battery is started to wear off so quick already
when i have bought this laptop plug felt on display but its not that much force that displays has broken there itself
all ok except battery
battery is goodperformance is awesomedisplay very goodbut sound speaker not good for high volume listening anything very problematic
display touching keyboard frame some times system not working just hold display till power off with direct switch
performance is good fast battery and camera worst also display is not upto the mark it is light weighted but have to handle with care due to plastic build quality review after 15 days
not durable rest of the things are ok
pro 1 great performance with low price 2 built quality is amazing3 processor is good 4 no lag5 you should do everything in this laptopcons 1 heating problem2 battery is drain so fast3 sound quality is not so good
product is nice but battery is very bad only in 1 hour battery finishes after full charged and not as much attractive as i thought from internally but we can use it in other features in a nice way

dont buy
battery backup is not good rest is fine
sound is very slow
battery backup is not good
it was ok
good allover but battery is low but performance is good and display is good
everything is good except the battery performance its very poor
laptop is good under 60k is good but screen quality and speaker quality not up to mark there is no base in voice i suggest you to go for lenovo because of camera shutter and good speaker i choose this bcoz of budget and hdd slot msi bravo 15 is amazing but absence of hdd slot thats why i choose this 
honest review if you aare going for this laptop there is a one major problembuild quality of laptop is worse you can even sense when you hold the laptopyeah some peoplemwill say that is gives flexibility and anyother stuff i have been using this laptop since 9months i suggest go for acer or pay more and go for asus best build quality and gives you best look and performancedefinately go for asus
after using for 4 months i can say thatit is affordable gaming is quite brilliant gta 5 or god of war run very smoothly battery have major issue if 80 charge game will be played for 80 minutes not more than it overall it is very fast and easy
if you are looking for solely gaming then go for i5 11 gen its better then ryzen 5600h in terms if gaming i have noticed sudden frame drops while playing gta v and others high end gamesframe drops are rare but yeah you will see some jitters while gamingover all the product is okayish performance is avg battery is kinda low although battery doesnt really matters much the only things really good would be its thermals i would suggest u to explore other options as there are better
ssd ram is not brandedhynix ram ssd is installed in it other wise the laptop is good if you just upgrade to good ssd and ram

battery performance is a big issue in this laptop model normal usage is consuming so much battery power when i have not played a single only giving 25 hrs backupi would say for a new laptop its very low overall laptop is okay hp should work on its battery 
writing this after using it for few months battery is not so impressive looks like it doesnt last more than 152 hours at this price one expects at least 45 hours of battery backup
build quality is very poor on right hand side of the screen there is a noticeable gap between plastic frame and screen it feels like there is a black line on the screen
everything thing is ok but display can crack easly very bad build quality please carefully open it flexible display panal
good laptopbut one problem the wifi speed is too low the same internet when connected to my other laptops and mobile iam getting good speed but i have to sit near to the modem for good speed
battery is draining very fast only after normal use like browsing etc
overall product is good but display settings by default is very bad i had to manually adjust settings to make it useableit has hdd bay i install a hdd in it but hdd data transfer is extremely slow making the use of hdd almost useless
ok for value of money for designing it works little slow
the product has issues when it reaches battery level of 25 it lags plus has hanging issues battery life is less than 3hrs
everything is good touchpad is making noise when touched battery is average
all over good condition but battery capacity is very bad

finishing is not good not properly placed on table
not the best looking laptop in this budget since you can get the stunningly slim and lightweight infinix x1 neo and x1 slim but this acer laptop has still got a kind of old school charm to it yes its bulky and feels heavy especially coming from a former dell latitude user but the processor is really good for the price amd ryzen 3 3250u is better than most intel chipsets which you get in laptops under 2530k i ordered it only and only because of the chip and nothing else and thats exac

definitely the best if your budget is under 55k i got it for 52k during the big billion day sale i thought of going for hp pavilion with ryzen 5 5600 which is better processor compared to ryzen 5 4600 but the hp pavilion design and keyboard colour looks dull and unattractive i am very satisfied with this laptop everything is fine till now i have been using it for 5 days i will provide the full review after a couple of months battery is good considering a gaming laptop gives me ar
one of the best laptop for under 60kperformance is excellent i dont find any lag during multi tasking or gaming battery back up is very good it could give a battery life of around 3hrs while gaming and around 5 to 6 hours for browsing rgb was turned off and display brightness was around 20 mostly display is very good but not very colour accurate so if youre buying this for editing purposes i wont recommend this because of the colour accuracy issuebuilding quality and

a very good laptop overall for regular use the design and build quality are top notch as always asus has made an excellent machine keeping users in mind the laptop reminds of the old days when laptops used to be bulky and included led indicators for things like power and caps lock the multiple indicators are really helpful especially the red indicators on power button and caps lock look cool the power button shape also gives it a great look the keyboard is as close to a classic keybo
the laptop is pretty amazing in the price range i have played far cry 3 and witcher 3 on it and it processed both of them very smoothly the graphics are also amazingthe things i liked the most are the screen size and the refresh rate both of them makes you love to work on it the keys are also smooth the 90whr battery performs as promised although one major drawback i faced was that sometimes there comes a lag between the audio and video when connected to a bluetooth headset nor

good to use for normal computer things like working surfing listening music or to play light games because once you start playing heavy games like cod or warfare the laptop heats to the top level where it can burn your hand fan speed noise irritates and battery dont lasts for long so not recommended for gaming and dont write its a gaming laptop its just normal general fast performance laptop i am unsatisfied because my purpose was to play high definition games but i am not able t

budget friendly laptop i can never buy any other brand laptop on this budget the performance is good and cool looking laptop worth for money
first of all its a fabulous laptop for gaming it is good for those who are looking for more than casual gaming but it is not for those who want be a professional gamer good laptop for this price range
all is good but battery performance is very poor
best gaming laptop you can buy in this price segment but few things you have to consider the battery life is pretty low and its wight is 23kg although other things are superb 
best intel i5 laptop can be used for multi taskingdisplay is very good and response time is very fastbody design is very good light weight easily can be carried while traveling overall a very good laptop by lenovo
this is a very good laptop i bought it for 43k in sail it gives the best performance dont expect battery life from this after it is a gaming laptop because it gives the good performancedisplay also good oneyou can go for it 
this variant of lenovo is really amazingits running smoothly with zero lag additional features like lenovo vantage lets you explore and monitor your battery and software performance and makes gaming experience fun and its easy to access all featuresthe slanted edge on laptop lid gives amazing front look over all its best you can code and play heavy games with above 40 fps it really cool laptop because i got it around 42000 including credit cardoffer
of first look its awesome if u like a plain design then its best for you performance is awesome but theres one problem the battery its 45wh it would be better if it was 75hw or more anyways it is a best budget gaming laptop who dont want to invest a large amount of money go for it
nice laptop good performance good battery display brightness is something less than other laptops overall it is a good look and good quality product
nice laptop best for highspeed internet and smooth work for gaming

good finesh diamond qulaity
performance is outstanding at this price pointoverall look and build quality is goodbut battery performance is slightly not good is enough for 34 hours using
getting gaming laptop at this price is the best choicewithout any doubt buy it 
laptop booting speed is so fast and run smoothly processor is very good other file and software open so earlier loved this product thanks flipkart
display is amazing and performance is very fast and overall if you have bought in sale than its a very good dealthe only problem i have faced is battery drains very fast
value for money 44k battery backup very poor performance only 1 2 hours only purchasing date 5102022
good laptop for all everything
an complete all rounder but the battery backup is a little less
very nice thankyou flipkart
nice
everyone saying that its worth of money but battery problem but in my point of view its electronic device no one can guarantee 100 lets see
value for money product i got this laptop for 45k with bank offer the delivery was very safe and genuine no damage
good
the speaker quality is very bad sound is lower than a mobile phone speaker
value for money
build quality is very poor and low quality plastic is usedtrack pad is average and difficult to handle need to use a separate mouse insteadbattery drains very fast so without power plugin not recommended to useheating too much in small tasks also plastic build may get damaged because of this heatnot useful for every day
ok but
battery backup was soo soo sooo worst and its draining very fast this laptop always use with plugin socket and sometimes i feel whether i purchased laptop or desktop display also having very low brightness performance was average overall it is a not bad and not good product i think realme laptops are more better than this laptop
it is good laptop for those who are excited to play more games
this laptop is good design wise and performance wise the issue is its battery only company said 8 hrs battery backup but it has only 2 to 3 hrs so battery rating is 2 out 5
battery drains really fast and windows office is not preinstalled just trial version is there
great choice
causal and not so good battery backup is worst
speaker is not good
laptop is good but delivery delay 
this laptop is overall worth for money performance and speed is very good but audio is little low otherwise your for your money 
waste product dont buy your money is only replacement and return not working
just few days and start hanging
wrost laptop battery give only 2h performancescreen problem after 5 days and referess rate 60 hz
as far as the gaming capabilities concerned this laptop has only one 1 ram slot everything else is great 
payment issueafter return period it will start to deduct more than actual value if you buy on credit card
battery back up only 4 hours after full charge no window 11 access its to be purchase from ms office totally i ma not happy to buy this product because 46k invested for laptop and battery backup no longer and again invest for ms office purchase one of bad experience
quite good as expected
its really very good in this price
battery drained without any usage and heating issue one ram slot available
5g network is not connecting to it its 60 hz display
excellent product but faced little touchpad issue at starting due to updates overall this laptop is beast on this price segment display is marvelous best gaming experience in this laptop

only have one ram slot and one memory slot i feel its not value for money
writing this review after 5 days of use and i would say i really like this product and i got it at 37k with exchange and other discount let me tell you my perspective gaming was not my priority but why i choose this because based on my research and cost prediction i was getting other i5 laptop within same rangeso why not choose a laptop with graphics card secondly upgradbility you can put multiple ssdhdd which u really cant do with other laptop and it gives you accessories to put ssd 
good
nice laptop compare to all leptop
very nice and fast i like it
everything is nice at this cost battery backup is 5h if you start using at 100 web camera is not good but its ok overall uh can buy it if u are able to compromise with battery and camera

value for money laptop battery backup is low but thats expected from a gaming laptop bought a 512 nvme ssd and 8 gb 2933 sodimm ram during the sale and upgraded the laptop gaming has improved by a lot after ram upgrade
i loved the product the exterior look of the laptop is amazing the performance is great but the battery backup is upto 23 hours if you are doing some work whereas it consumes more when you are playing games till now i am not facing any problem if you want a high performance laptop for gaming or programming and budget friendly go fo it

charging issue and current issue 
from past 10 months im searching for a best gaming laptop today i found it and i can say my choice is perfect mindblowing gaming laptop at a reasonable price very fast bootingwith in a blink of eye many people have a dream to become a gamer but due to high price everyone cannot afford a gaming laptop but msi made it possible with this low price and high specifications without any second thought we can buy it i had a few doubts about the laptop and msi customer service cleared all
first of all thanks to flipkart and msi for providing such a machine at 59k during sale perioddisclaimerim a professional editor and my review will based on productivity usage and not gamingive been using this laptop for about a month now and during the period ive used it in many scenarios such as on location during shoot for basic data transferring and proxy creation to editing rough cuts while travelling in a train and overall i love this laptop for the price i bought it i can
great product by msi at a steal price will run most of current aaa titles at high or mid settingspros best deal for its pricertx 3050hexa core i5 10500h2 year warranty great optimization by msi light weight is a add on advantage for studentsall of that for 58k is rare to findcons cant ask more for the price but battery life improvement and a rgb backlit would be appreciatedoverall happy with the purchase
i needed the best performance and a good display at budget and i guess i have made a very nice decision this thing is a beast gaming and 1080p video editing is such a delight in this machine well done msi 
this is a great gaming laptop i m not a hardcore gamer but it suits my needs if you re looking for a casual gaming laptop that preforms as well as the more expensive brands this is a great pick the graphics are crisp sound quality is better than i expected and it connects easily with headphones and wireless mouse i would recommend a full size keyboard for the laptop
first look review will update more latergot this in bbd sale at 59k looks good 144hz display is quite good512gb ssd is not enough so needs additional hddram is expandable upto 64gb basic msi softwares that are included are good tootested with basic games like csgo and valoboth ran smoothlyno heating issues as such on first looku can go for it if ur budget is tight nd want to explore ray tracing 186kg for a gaming laptop is lit tbhif u dont ve issues with servicing u
received this just a few hours back the things i noticed after some light usage like browsing and installing applications arepros 1 ssd is fast ive used only hdd before so this was the first thing i noticed2 temperatures are usually 60c for both gpu and cpu for light use note that this has only one fan but it is unbelievable how cool this system stays even in no air conditioning rooms3 pretty lightweight just marvel at how much this is packing but in so little spacecons1
who and why if your budget around 65k you need laptop for daily work studies and occasional gaming 720p 1080p enough power for multitasking 6 cores 12 threads good looks medium work load can run vms docker integration servers etc i am not talking full prod environment but you can present pocs video editing is possible 1080p v easily can do almost anything 4k u can do basic if you add multiple layers then timeline will lag games tested skyrim special ed
after testing 3 daysmy points of viewspros1 gamings performance is so good considering price you will not find the same performance laptop in this range 2 crispy display3 advanced bios by msi for overclock on software side its really good you will get the other preloaded msi apps which i find useful for day to day task4 chasis is good thin and elegantcons1 power cord port should be in back it is in left side of laptop2 single fan but thermal is goodconsiderin
the machine is quite powerful and runs aaa titles upto 2018 effortlessly for normal usage i dont stream or have massive external monitors so cant say much about those scenarios but if youre looking for a machine that does what it says by its own hardware this is a simply a great investment also runs cadcnc software no problemone heads up do not install the latest nvidia drivers from the nvidia website only download if needed the recommended nvidia drivers from the msi websi
one of the best laptops got it on sale and couldnt hope for anything better the battery is a little bit on the lower side but the display performance sound and the freedom to tweak the settings as per consumers requirement is just amazing the build quality is fantastic though there can be smudges i was quite skeptical about the fan sound but it isnt too much as several other reviews have said also on using headphones you wont hear any disturbance from that gaming and productivity
works effortlessly in most of the aaa titlesplayed rdr2 ac valhalla and it gave stable 4050 fps on medhigh settings battery backup and thermals could have been better otherwise a great deal at under 60k
im not gamer i purchased this lappy for my editing purpose till now its quit fair at this price value for money getting heat little bit during premier but thats fineperformance is quit good with this specification and the best part is it comes with 2yr warranty as msi known forim using from last one week and happy with that
144hz screen with a super fast ssd and a backlit keyboard along with a rtx 3050 is satisfying enough already but the thermals were a huge surprisei played some demanding games and that too at ultra settings for checking gpu throttling but the temps remained as if i was playing valorant under 80 degrees at all times the idle temp was also super chill at around 50 degreesthe games i tested were gta 5 control plague tale innocence all at ultra although for the best frame rates notch it
super fast and looks classy performance oriented machine loved it 
premium for sure in reality its looks way more cooler than in image value for money product msi has done great job at optimization display amazing speaker are clear and louder than most other laptop well i loved it performance is like a beast build quality top notch thats it for now i got this laptop today
i got that laptop during the sale i got it at 59k which is absolutely bang for the pricelets talk about laptop 1 great gaming experience provider2comes with rtx 3050 graphic card which is extremely amazing for gamers3it has ips level display at 144hz refresh rate4comes with backlight keyboard and much morei fully suggest u just go for it
everything works great i am basically using autocad 2023 runs smoothly no problem capable for running high graphics games overall good experience
ordered it on 852022 for 61kincluding card offers got it in three days it came with windows 10 but as soon as i booted it up i got windows 11 update and its performing smooth with it and the connectivity options to your phone transfer and accessing data is very much easier sadly no ms office full version i like the option of enabledisable webcam with function keythe build is plastic and weight is much lighter for a gaming laptop the given 8gb ram 512 gb ssd 450 gb available
the laptop is great and can provide a maximum of 144 fps even with a 3050 rtx because of other limitations the web cam is not that good but so if you need to attend calls with this then probably not the best choice for gaming purposes although its good but it often heats upto 5570 during gaming
though this machine is good but have a drawback it has only dedicated graphics card output if something went wrong with graphics card then display will not work on igpu in todays era most of the laptops have graphics switchable from igpu to dedicated and vica versa it help in long battery backup and laptop usability in case of dedicated graphics card fails

its the best laptop ive ever seen and used i glad and grateful to buy this laptop and be a member of msi community 
just go for it if your budget is below 65kthis is the best you can get i got it for 587 k in big billion saledont expect battery to withstand hours of work but for 3hours max after full charge always connect the charger remove it unless its necessary other than this con its fantastic to work on programming languages such as pythonsql and ms office which im working on currentlyno lagsstutters or annoying things like device brick or errors win11 is awesome which is legal given with t
the product is so good so fare giving a pretty decent performance at this price range you cant find a better laptop in this price segment as i am using it always plugged in i havent faced any lag issues i would suggest msi to improve thermals because while heavy gaming gta temperature rises a little bit
best and perfect since this is a gaming laptop use it while using an external laptop cooling pad which is available online design is very cool and classy more than images and performance is best i totally recommend it
gifted this to my brother and touchwood its going fine till now hopefully everything is well as of now was really sceptic as i have never placed anything online that too an expensive thing well done flipcart
laptop is automatically shutdowns even battery is 40 i will not recommend it they need to work a lot and lot of heating issues by the way i am writing this after 4 months of use same problem occurring to from day 1 it is not worth of this price there are good options asus in market
let me start by saying this is not my first gaming laptop this is the 3rd gaming laptop in my family and the second msi laptop in my family have a asus rog g551jk which was my 1st gaming laptop then a msi gp75 leopard 9se485in which was bought in dec 2019 because of which i decided to go for another msi laptop which is this laptop msi gf63 thin i5 with rtx pros1this laptop is a beast i am able to run all the latest games without any problems the performance of the laptop is aw
great laptop bought it for 63k on sale cpus great gpu could have been better if it used more than 40 watt battery not great 3 hour backup on all battery saving options on its using hynix 8gb 3200mhz ram which is sadly clocked at 2933mhz bought another 3200mhz 8gb ram for it it has kingston nvme m2 ssd dont know why fps is low on valorant avg 140 fps intel has done a good job on this 10500h cpu it took me 2 hours and 6 minutes to install red dead redemption 2 dodi repack ov
been using for almost 10 hours right now satisfied with the performance but the fans are noisy when youre using gpu too much like i was testing the raytracing with minecraft for raytracing and the fan sound went very high otherwise its a great purchase
this is a good laptop 512ssd8gb ram4gb rtx graphics are the best in the sell price go for it but the only problem is with fun and heating issue if you can manage it it is the best offer at 63k
very good laptop wouldnt say its recommendable to purchase it for sole reason of traveling as battery backup is not something best out there if you want a good battery backup go for a work focused laptop probably dell or hp i saw people not considering this after hearing its tgp which is frankly low when you see the card used but trust me i have been using it for almost 9 months now and can tell u it didnt affect performance i play valorant on it and i can play it on 144fps thanks
good product at this price but it heats a lot while playing games now its even upgraded to win 11
powerful but battery backup is not up to the mark can handle most of the games at high setting though upgrading the ram would be a good idea overall i am very satisfied with the performance and display only two things that are stopping me from giving it 5 stars are battery backup and body of the laptop which easily gathers finger prints
one of the best machines of msi i use this laptop for my data science projects and all the developer apps work flawlessly it is highly recommendedprosa it weighs under 2kgb hexacore processor 6c 12tc ram upgrade options available to up to 64gbd 144 hz refresh rate screen and ips level displaye dedicated shortcut key for the camera where one can disableenablesecured the camera in no timef temperatures are well maintainedconsa only redcolored keyboard no r
an excellent value for money upgradable only ram storage gaming laptop 144hz refresh rate a geforce rtx graphics card 10th gen i5 hexacore 12 threads processor what more do you want at this priceoh and also the design is pretty slick with impressive build quality
have you ever watched the movie beauty and the beast well this laptop by msi is a beauty as well as a beast i510500h along with the rtx 3050 4gb graphics works as smooth as butter as the i51500h has 6cores and 12 threads there wont be any bottleneck issues we get a 144hz refresh rate screen that too with an antiglare display with 45 ntsc color gamut at this price its more than enough the webcam could have been improved a bit but well a lot of gaming laptops are doing away w
best laptop in both price and perfermance in 63k it was really a very good opportunity to buy this during big billion days really rtx 3050 gives a beast power to this finally happy to buy this
the laptop is good in this price point of 62k the performance is really goodeverything is good except the battery at battery saver mode also it cannot work for more than 2 hoursso always have to hook with the power plug
one of the best laptop at this price range144hz will nail it battery backup is normal cant expect more on gaming laptop with these awesome features cooling is awesome in this once it gets heat it will get cool soo quick graphics are ultimate in this weight is good performance is overall awesome 
very much value for the bucks product its super fast and except the fact that gpu is only 40w i havent found much of a con with this product suggesting you all to upgrade the ram to 16 gb and same with ssd also it comes with a 512 nvme you can purchase a 25inch ssd
one of the best out there in this price pointmake sure to add an extra ssd or else you will run into storage issuei would also recommend for 16gig ramthe performance is butter smooth so far i have tried valorant warzone ark read dead redemption and fifa 19 you can play with out any lags or glitches and the thermals are pretty good considering the price point i will recommend it for sure its a deal breaker at 56k use credit card for extra 3000 off
one of my best purchases till dateabsolute beast around 56 hrs of battery backup on normal usage despite the fact of it being a game centric lappyi am not a big gamer but i played valorant on this baby and oh good lord this thing delivers constant 220 fps epic speaker sound couldve been a little louder but i really dont use it much coz i prefer headphones display is absolutely gorgeous and more than enough brightkeyboard backlit level is also adjustablecamera is me
glad to purchase this one first its looks unique and exclusiveeveryone ask which laptop is this not known upgradable as well like in storage and ram heating is minor depends upon your room temprature as well recommend you go for cooling pad as wellinbuilt speakers are sufficient but not loud inbuilt microphone works 45 camera quality is good 455edit after using some while ago i have to upgrade its ssd and ram then its working smoothly and fine
this is awesomethis is my first laptopand i choose msi because my friends suggested me and it is also most trusted brandand i5 6core rtx 3050 gpu is a beast in this price range and is a very affordable laptopno other laptop will come closer to this in this price rangegaming performance is also totally satisfiedi recommend this laptop to all types of work good work msi 
first off all the delivery was fast and perfectdid all performance and basic tests everything came out just goodi5 10th gen especially 10500h is great with the best single core score compared to other competitors at the same price range and may be abovertx at this price even though its 40w it outranks other gtx variant at this price range with ray tracing and dlss optionthe only thing i was concerned about is the thermal but with the cooler boost 3 on it gives me steady clock speed
amazing laptop at a good budget price pointpros1 great display 144hz really brings out the crispness in image quality2 rtx 3050 this is a powerful gpu that was able to run cyberpunk 2077 at high settings3 i5 10500h is powerful processors and can handle all games easilycons ram is only 8 gb at 65k they could have given us 16 or 12 gb ramprocessors heat up to 85 and sometime 89 celsius
the performance is smooth and the compact form factor is awesomeeasy poratabilityvery good for playing csgovalorant and dota 2u could add extra ssd and ram from msi service centre onlyorelse the warranty will be voidedregister the product at msi website as soon as u get the hands on itscreen is awesomesound is goodheat dissipation is decent40 watt tgpu rtx 3050performs more than expectedsimply go for it and save some extra bucks
all i see is a grt machine light weighted super fast hexa core i must say surely need a little hdd or ssd update because space kinda runs low after some time and it does need a power connection soon as you start playing game battery lasts good while doing normal usage but is gone super fast as soon as u start playing game and the only thing i hated is that the system starts using integrated graphics when the battery runs under 30 and turns off the rtx otherwise the machine doesnt 
one of the best gaming laptops out there in this price range and no you need not be a gamer for this laptop to suit your needs its heavy duty processor and graphics ensure that it can handle your daily multitasking gaming and core intensive softwares with ease go with it if better display and performance are your topmost requirements and all this without not burning a hole in your wallet
best in this price range
best laptop for the price very good performance and thermal managementthe cinebench score is very good geekbench score is also goodssd speed is very fastgames run very smooth thanks to the rtx 3050overall this is unbelievable at its price range i will give a 55 in every waythis is a portablepowerhouseperformer
light weight rtx 3050 best in its range
i literally loved the product at the price point i have bought it during bbd i just found one issue with my charger it produces little bit earthing an as laptop is also made up of metal it feels little earthing like touch all over may be i can live with it
i loved this laptop the performance is really amazing with so low price i am using this laptop for almost 3 weeks now and till now i havent encounter any problem the rtx 3050 even though 40w performs really well
there is no doubt about the laptop but in some games iam getting lower fps then gtx 1650 main valorant other than that laptop is awesome
please dont buy this particular version worst design and worst battery backupif u try to switch on the system by pressing power on button it wont open only keyboard light will glow and fan will rotate and then full black screenthen u have to press and hold the power on button for few second once it turn off then u have to press the power on button later after sometime it will openthese are the problem actually its my replacement laptop first i got defective one it wont poweron its
this pc is beast at this prize
great laptop at this price range only problem is that the battery is not good even for simple usage could have given 1 tb of storage instead of 500gb 500gb is what you get for a low pricespec laptop but performance wise love it
worth it
i bought this at 58k during bbd sale and it justified the pricein the said price range it is very competetive and affordable machine ill list the areas which i feel could be improved later in the review1 144hz monitor awesome2 it is very light3 build quality is ok does not feel cheap4 thermals as soon as cpu temp reaches 80 it comes down automatically same is for gpu too but the temperature threshold for gpu is above 80 degree celsius heat will not be noticed while p
worst battery
looking nice
fabulous 
awesome laptop but battery backup could be better
battery backup is not good nd flipkart is taking so much of time to refund it and touchpad is also not working
vey bad product
overall great performancenice for gaming and other routine workdisplay is awesome
been using this for 2 months and i have to say this is pretty excellent laptop in this price pointonly cons i had is with battery backup min 3hrs when keyboard light is off and 50 brightness and keeping this laptop clean its a finger print magnet apply a skin or else it will bother you
purchased this for 585k i couldnt have made a better choice although battery discharges first but thats common with every gaming laptop moreover not doing heavy tasks and using it on low settings can give a battery life of 67 hours
good performance nice product
super laptop
awesome 
looks fantastic lightweight nd very user friendly
what to say im totally satisfied with price and performancewas waiting to buy an msino comments
perfect beast 
sooooo good
the best budget gaming laptop rtx 3050i5 10500h8gb ram512gb ssd144 hz screen refreshedthis is budget gaming laptop all overthank you flipkart and msi
its price worthyeverything is good at this price range its a beast 
fantabulous rtx on 
in under a month the fan started making noise sounds like it has been losen and vibrating
nice laptop with rtx3050 dont think of 40 tgp you will get awesome fps during gaming heating is a problem usually on the upper side of the keys 
no need to worry about to buy this laptop 
the performance was good no complaints about it the only con is the poor battery life the laptop barely sustained for 3hrs with normal usage from being 100 charge i hope these issue might gets fixed in the future
battery issues with the laptop
best laptop in 5560k
value for money
great performance and a real value for money pproduct if you want a gaming beast under 60k then you should consider this i am satisfied with this purchase but just want to know about its services because i heard msi have bad service quality after purchase just one sugesstion dont use google chrome because it will impact your gaming experience i know you all will think what am saying but in my case suddenly chrome started using high cpu and using cpu full potentiol and then games start lagging
such an excellent piece of machinery i will definitely say that this is just best in this price range it does all the normal day to day tasks easily and when it comes to gaming its damn good and with the help of msi dragon center software you could tweak the performance and cooling accordingly which brings out the beast out of the i5 6 core processor the gpu
this is one of the best designs when it comes to upgradability it supports double sided nvme drives so you can easily upgrade it to 2tb gen 4 drives or beyond also it will clock down to 2933mhz if you place a 3200mhz ram tested it with 2x 32gb 3200mhz micron ram
battery gets discharged quickly but overall it is value for moneyif u get in under 60k it worth itin this price range this is the only laptop to come with gpu 3050overall good experiencethanku msi
best laptop but only problem is battery backup
used for 3 month not charging nowtotal waste of moneypoor customer service
pretty good laptop at this price but thermals could be better
awsome laptop in this price point very very smmoth and fast laptop
perfect
amazing
i am totally satisfied with this laptop i could ask for more in this price range i compared my friends laptop which he bought for 90k and my 60k laptop rivalled it soo how can i complain but the build quality could be better if i paid some more but performance is too notch
best in this price
no cons this is beast in price segment someone think about tgp of rtx 3050 is low but guys i tell that it perform even well that 75 watt tgp nitro
it has been a month and its working smoothly
the best laptop in the budget everything is the best but battery is just good
good
best in this price rangebest thing is the weight of it excellent sound quality16gb ram would better for this system
the screen is amazing you cant compare with another laptop but battery is not good as per my usage only i have got battery issue and everything is good
a go grab it product 
gaming performance is really good but if you are looking for a battery backup get yourself something else its functions and built is really good
avg

more than expected experience high graphics gaming only at 75 degree celcius
good performance
amazing product
great performance from this beast dont expect high battery backup as it is designed for performance design is nice top part is steel and the keyboard area is hard plastic with metal finish high quality speakers 144hz display is a delight
at this price range it is good product you can go for it without any hassle
received the product a week ago a steal at the price in all ways the laptop is a power house but lacks battery backup and the single fan makes some noises often detailed review once i push it to the maximumupdate after a monththe battery back up is pathetic its really worrying often times if i run fifa with the best settings the battery hardly lasts an hour otherwise its a steal really need to figure out something for it appreciate any tips if you have

thermal issue frequent crashes clock speed decreases at high temperature
waste laptop
electric earthing problem while charging
everything is great with this laptop except for the battery life good for entry level gaming
it is an amazing gaming laptops no lags at all 
very bad battery backup only 2hrs screen goes black dont waste your money
it not worth it even gtx 1650 does a better job than 3050 because of the heating thermals in thia system is close to volcano itself i would say dont go for it
the best gaming laptop in this price range not doubt performance is awesome thinking to buy it so dont wait go place the order
writing this review after using this laptop for one year proswhen gaming we dont have throttling theres room for upgrading when it comes to thestorage and ram the temperatures are reasonable under heavyusage fan noises are quieterplasticaluminum chassisoverall worth buyingbest budget gaming machine msi never disappoints
good for 1080p gaming battery backup decreased after performing msi battery calibration also the laptop freezes randomly everyday during normal surfing load and i have to restart itedit freeze issue solved after windows 11 update
super as expected finger print problem is true is sure does collect a lot of them
best laptop in best price but battery backup is lower expect battery backup everything is superb under this price range
1 this laptop have 40 watt gpu but still give performance similar to 60 watt of same varient 2 battery backup is somewhat around 4 hrs depend upon work 3 heat yes it heat while playing heavy game but manageable i feel heat on keyboard but bearable but i recommend cooling pad
heating issue in this laptop you cant even touch the upper part of laptop after playing game for 1 hour
quite a good product but if your considering battery performance dont go with it
too much heating problem after one hour its hot like induction
excellent laptop at this price
hello everyone please dont buy this laptop it has battery issue battery already replaced once in 1 year and again in 2 months same battery issue is popping up without usage the battery will be dead you cant use laptop without charger
best laptop in this prize segment must buy but some things doesnt mentioned online like only have one fan for cooling rtx 3050 is 40 watt tgp screen and brightness is really good decent camera and very light weight comes with 120 watt charger win 11 no microsoft office activation build quality is really good even it is 156 inch but dont have numerical keypad overall best laptop in this prize segment

 beast 
its nice product in resonable price working good
add more 56k to your budget and buy some other rtx 3050 laptop this one has only 40 watt and only one fan so it heats alot and u might face cpu throttling and the display is average

in this price range it is absolutely best ith has rtx 3059 there nothing else to say
got this beast at 60k its damn fast and responsive msi is the best 
it is a great product i only saw temprature reaching high about 70 to 80 while playing heavy games would have loved if it would have dual fan but then in this price range this is more than money can bye 
best for the price
extremely worth of buying
nice
nice product but requires cooling pads for long life
this would be a 10 if more memory was available playing graphics heavy aaa games can sometimes be challenging if too many applications are open i would recommend upgrading the memory to 16 gb for better performance other than this minor issue the laptop works fine
ok its been 10 days i have got it this is very good laptop only issue in this laptop is battery u need charger where ever u go and performance and other things good
best rtx laptop in this price
this is a very powerful laptop with amazing processing speed

charger wire is a bit loose from adapter i contacted customer support for that but they were asking for both laptop and charger to fix it did anyone else also face the same issue with charger 
simply perfect
very good performance
good product but little high cost
the device is really fast and snappy it can handle almost all the softwares smoothly installed windows 11 on this device recently and i must say performance and display quality is great it could have done better in battery department but this is expected from a gaming laptop although it has lowest tdp rtx 3050 gaming experience has been smooth till now i have played rocket league and fifa 21 there i was getting more than 100 fps keyboard red colour could have been better
love it super
good product 
excellent budget gaming laptop
its a wow material
good as expected
fantastic go for it
the laptop is surprisingly capable for the intended tasks of gaming mid and high end games even though it has a lower watt rtx 3050 gpu though it has only one fan it makes up by providing options of cooler booster which does its job very well it is well priced and good looking it is a bit of a finger print magnet but that is not a major issue
worth the

awesome product from msi
love it 
great laptop bought it on sale but heating is an issue while playing heavy games
best laptop under budget
good product overall

after acer predator the laptop i like the most is msi gf 63 because it delivers such a great performance at this price level with rtx graphic card awesome deal
nice product
good product everything is at its level apart the battery but its value for money and its worth it
good product in cheaper price
well i did purchased this laptop under 60k which is a good thing but after using it for my online study purposes which is through chrome as i opened a video on particular site the site where i had purchased the course it gets stuck and nothing happens the whole system froze and i need to hard restart by pressing the power buttonit happened with me 45 times continuously lastly i got fed up by doing this again and again and just had to download opera for the online videos stream
good performance but low battery backup good for gaming and casual use but battery life between 42 hours

bought this product some weeks ago and i am just loving it i did a lot of editing and gaming on this beast and it easily handles each task i recommend u all to upgrade ram for better performance gr8 work msi 
good laptop with worst battery backupits heat going beyond when u paly any kind of game service support is carry in is another drawback battery drain very fast i backup is only 2 hours
msi gf63 i5 10 gen rtx 3050 is good laptop at that price they are providing fitting part for future expansion ram and ssd it is provide true gaming experience keyboard and touchpad are excellent it gives experience of using macbook i am loved with msi dragon center where we monitor user laptop condition overall experience is very good

itsa awsome product from msi considering little bit heatingthe laptop was out of the mark i really loved it also customer support and build quality is very nice
overall great product in price range
great product by msi144hz displayrtx 3050red backlit keyboard i know many people think it hurts your eyes during night but works fine for mei would have preferred an amd cpu but it will work since its a 6core i5it can run a lot of new titles smoothly at medium settingsits a great deal in this price segmentsit looks cool dont expect much battery in a gaming laptopsound is good for a laptop2 years warranty at no extra cost is quite a clutch for final decision making
need a ram upgrade for smooth gaming
great for its price also pretty light weight for a gaming laptop satisfied with the purchase buy it if you get this under 65k without thinking twiceedit after 3 months of usestill working great survived tea spill over keyboard only downside is the red backlit keyboard whitebluegreen wouldve been better red is too harsh on eyesalso the battery is not that good8 months of usestill working great no issues whatsoever you cam trust msi

nice
its a perfect beauty and a perfect gaming machine at this price rangethe only thing thats annoying are that some keys in my laptop are slightly sunk
good job msi
everything is perfectly fine it works well but the outer meterial of the laptop is not as expected
best product in budget of 63k gaming coading at the top level
performance i was able to play games likes valorant and cs flawlessly so no issues heating every gaming laptop heats so keeping that in mind the thermals were good the only thing i would like them to improve is speakers theyre good but i expected them them to be a bit louder concluding its a good laptop at this price point you can go for it
just want to tell you best at its price the beast it is 
the product is good and delivers what it promises only one issue is that it has single fan setup while in product description it states it has dual fan setup also the chasis heat up a bit on the escape key part overall the product is excellent and best value for money it is light and has good build quality and best value for money laptop
used for 23 days performance is great display is awesome ram is less but its upgradeable cpu and gpu are perfectly matched in performance so they dont bottleneck each other battery life is good for a gaming laptop although i wouldnt recommend gaming on batteryfactory seal is big down point because without breaking that one cannot perform any upgrades this is a very negative point for msi as its known for gaming laptops so they should be easily upgradableall in all a good valu

good performance
very good product
battery backup is 35 hours in normal mode 15 hour in gaming little bitt heating issuesperformance is exceptional i think its better to go this this laptop because of 3050 rtx graphic card it is significant better than the gtx series cards in terms of feature3050 rtx is 10 better than 1650ti
this is the one i was looking for best performance as well as qualityloved it and above all giving me the best gaming experience
nice laptop with value for money specifications
if you are looking for a budget gaming laptop then this is the best pick in this segment
looks stylish and thin decent display but 144z makes everything look faster
everything is vey very good getting rtx at this price was so damn lucky i bought at last big billion days till now no issues i played aaa games like valorant gta 5 resident evil 6 at high graphics no lag till now but the only problem is gpu usage is low if we make that gpu to use more this will be beast i completely recommend it can anyone know to boost gpu usage kindly mention

this is one of the best laptop in the price segment rtx 3050 is a steal real so far i have tested all gramin laptops can have every thing packed in but the fact that this laptop is 1800grams makes it a monster with lightness

this laptop is the prime example of value for money earlier i was considering to buy acer nitro 5 i5 11th gen and then i saw some reviews and youtube and found out that this ryzen processor is newer and performs better in multi tasking and battery backup is better than the intel counterpart the laptop is very beautiful especially the ultra violet back lit keyboard and the design of this laptop is just so pretty i was lucky enough to cop this laptop even when this was out of stock
incredible buyhave been using it for past 5 daysflipkarts delivery was incredibly fast and appeared before due date in perfect conditioni havent tested gaming though but on a day to day task this machine is a beastyou can through anything at it it will play it with easemy work has been mostly for office usebattery backup is adequate for melooks stunningdont bother to look for any laptop at this price range just go for itwill update the gaming review shortly
overall laptop was so so awesome only the problem is it has less ports compare to other laptops charging also very fast battery backup was good enough as per your use design quality performance 100 fabulous must buy highly recommended you can buy this laptop and additional you can also purchase 1tb or 2tb hdd then alltogether it works faster compare to other models this laptop will worth it with all features
got it today the packaging was great and everything on the outside looks fine the laptop works as smooth as butter just go for it if you need a good laptop with high processing power worth the money will update my review after a weeks usage
the product was really good and best for gamingamd ryzen 5 5600h the processor is beast with 4gb nvidia geforce gtx display with 144hz is awesome156 inches but battery backup is average it should be improved other than that this laptop is best for 60k budget regarding delivery it was delivered within 24 hours really good iam satisfied and this laptop is value for money go for it
i didnt expect wow this is very good laptop and performance is nice and display also good but battery is average but its backup around 56 hrs easily in low brightness in normal uses and gaming aroun 335 but good overall you can buy this laptop its good i will give 5 stars 
in that price range its awesome ssd speed is very fast than imaginelap design is also goodscreen 144hz is nice and quality of screen is very goodbut battery need to improve
excellent delivery great display and refresh rategpu performance not up to the mark but still does the jobexcellent cpu performance and balanced thermalsperfectly runs games like control rdr2 gta online and so on
everything is good if you can grab one hp victus at same price that is more awesomebattery is pretty average but not that badplease note these thingsthere is no ms office with laptop you have pay extra for that type c is just for data transfer no charging support no finger print scanner
lapi is good performance is bestfrom last 7 days i am using it good performance and battery is goodthose who want to play game or use cad software it can be good choice 
this laptop is amazing and no one is comparable to this one in this price range if you want a laptop for gaming editing coding just go for it itll do all the work just as good so far i played valorant 144fps and fornite with 100fps around just got it 2 days back to getting used but will tell as i play more but this one is a beast in its price and offers everything one would need
lets start with the build quality the build quality is very average the laptop leaves finger stains all over its body its really annoying would recommend put on stickers on the body to avoid these finger imprints most important information after buying install and update the lates nvidia graphics drivers when i ran a game i was hardly getting 40fps after updating the drivers i got above 120fps constantly the battery backup was not good not expecting to be good tho it
best product under 65k budget go for itit will not disappoint youbelieve in pavilion the only concern is batterybut that is understandable that it is gaming laptop you cant expect much about battery backlit is just wow bcoz before purchasing i was not sure about how purple backlit would look but after seeing physically it really impressed me 
heres the review after 1 week performance is superb and gives excellent experience display is also superb 144hz gives best experience but if your not a gameing all time change into 60hz it gives some more battery life gaming experience is excellent but if you have to play games you always want to plugged cuz battery for gaming is worst battery is so bad they all said it gives 56 hours but in real normal usage 3 hours gaming 1 hour so bad for gaming 
as a normal user sharing the pros and cons herepros fast bootup it turns on in 10sec and turn off in 4 sec display quality is awesome runs too smoothly beautifully designed with purple backlitbacklit looks great but for the person uses backlit daily can go for white backlit purple is viberant no heating at allcons should have given ms office heavy weight wise plastic on the top of lid is softloose which feels laptop delicate from topi used plastic lamination

the laptop is fabulous highly recommendedmy personal opinion1 the performance is awesome would be more better with 16 gb ram but i dont have any problem because the ram is upgradable 2 the battery backup is not good enough for multimedia and movie watchers since it is a gaming laptop so you may not expect more than 5 hours on movies and multimedia but i think since it is a gaming laptop the battery backup is good enoughsince anybody is not gonna play games on the battery3t
100 satisfaction value for money productperformance of laptop is way better than other competitors at this price battery is little bit its minus point but it is a gaming laptop so its considerable it charges rapidly thanks to its 150w adaptor display is crisp clear display size156 144hz you can consider this gaming laptop in this price overall best gaming laptopprocessor ryzen 5 5600h amd radeon 550m integrated graphic card and geforce nvidia gtx 1650 dedicated graphic card
the overall performance of this laptop is goodi checked offline prices of the same laptop which is around 74kthus i bought laptop at 60k online im quite happy with the pricing and this is only laptop available of 5600h series at this price range the only cons is hp should have improved its build quality
best in this priceryzen 5 5600h 144hz screen what else do you needonly con is the battery back up is not much because the processor powerful and screen is 144 hzbut its a gaming laptop so plug in and play absolute beastgames that i tested valorant 200 fps genshin impact 60 fps stablepubg pc 60 fps
laptop is good under 60k is good but screen quality and speaker quality not up to mark there is no base in voice i suggest you to go for lenovo because of camera shutter and good speaker i choose this bcoz of budget and hdd slot msi bravo 15 is amazing but absence of hdd slot thats why i choose this 
this laptop has excellent performance and i used laptop for this 4 months one issue i had found that keyboard r key is not working when i buy this laptop but their hp service is very good day before yesterday they came to our house and change the new keyboard panel and its working fine our home also in a village but they come and fix that issue thank you hponly battery backup comes for 3 to 4 hrs but other than that its very in this offer price
awesome productthe main pros of this product is display crisp and clear look like an olednext thing is very smooth in this price compare with othersthis is beast
i have been using this laptop for last 1 months with external keyboard and mouse and i caught some issues which are 1 something the usb post dont work so i need to interchange the keyboard cable to other usb port and mouse to that usb port2 somethimes the wifi dont know work at all so i need to reboot the laptop this used to happen with my previous laptop also this wifi problemwait for next review
writing this review after 1 week of usageeverything is just awesome good for daily work and gaming no complaints comes with windows 11 home out of the box but doesnt have windows office which is the only fault else it lit and another thing which is lit is the backlit keypad just love it
got it for 54k worth the money processor heating issues not observed but the m2 ssd area gets hot around 60 degrees which maybe normal hence the heat sink processor usually works between 45 and 95 degrees need to add ram for better performance hdd slot available but may need to change stock bracket ad it only support ssd overall good experience
liked the laptop i have a msi gaming laptop i7 16gb the performance of the laptop seems than that of msi the battery back also seems good though i havent played any games on it with music and browsing i am getting 3hrs plus the violet color keyboard doesnt feel so good but its ok

its great at this price range loved this laptop performance is really great and i also loved this design 
best budget gaming laptop impressed with the overall performance of this laptop have been using it over two weeks or so and it performs really well the ryzen processor runs cooler than the intel variant can upgrade this to 16gb with the additional ram slot make sure to opt for open box delivery and check the authenticity of the productprosdisplay is brilliantbattery is pretty goodno lag issues faced with most games soft touch keyboardlooks fantasticconsaudio intensity is a b
beast performance good audio quality display is also good only battery last for 3 hr so use on adapter while doing heavy tasks thermals are good it dont heat too muchdo no wobble i bought it rather than victus because victus wobble a lotbought it for58490 decent budget but if have no issue with wobble go for victus it has good battery life thermal are also good
it is best gaming laptop things i love in this laptop is its thermal and 144 hz refresh rate display and amd ryzen 5 5600h with gtx 1650
best laptop in this price range i got it at around 54k in big billion days i am a very light user and i have never played any game nor will i try but may be i can try a few cricket games in future display display is good but brightness could have been more 144 hz is very smooth battery i have used it around 2 hours for internet surfing and watching videos and battery decreased from about 55 to 25 percent so thirty percent for two hours seems good maybe gaming will consume m
pros display quality is excellent 55audio quality 55we update to windows 11 1 month mso validitykeyboard quality is good 55less boot time less than 7 secondsconsbattery 45 hr0 brightness medium brightness 23 hr nothing more i loved it a lot its a beast 
ryzen 5 5600h is a beast6c 12t best for editing programming and gaming as well nice thermals good build quality though fingerprint marks annoys me sometimes graphics card gtx 1650 is good for decent gaming and can run almost every new generation games in medium settings 40 fps
pros1 good display2 manageable temperatures3 budget friendly value for money cons1 keys are not visible even during the day without backlit on2 performance sometimes throttles for a few seconds while playing gamesconclusion great buy for the price further you can update ram and ssd as well whenever needed
all of the performance of this laptop was literally good but battery is not goodin my opinion this laptop is a beast im very happy with this laptop thankyou flipkartfor giving me this best deal
only cons which were not deal breaker are1 hinge wobbling while typing aggressively or kept right under the fan with 5 speed2 colours displayed on the screen are not vibrant they are dull but you got 144 hz refresh rate so no need to worry3 trackpad height is less bcoz of that speaker grills you can manage it by purchasing a mouse4you can get the battery backup of 35 to 4 hours on light usage if your work is heavy you shouldnt expect a good battery life in a gaming laptop a
all the things are good come with beast processor allthe things are pros cons battery backup is less hinj may get loose faster as her older versions have that problemcomes with massive blotware suggetion if you need performance just buy it blindly and reinstall windows with iso from microsoft website windows license automatic it takes and blotware get removedover all loved the product
ok the laptop is good and its worth buying but look for discounts the thing by which i am not impressed is its sound and battery life it hardly gives you a 4 hr battery life on a normal use and my phones sound is more louder than its sound rest everything is perfect i loved it
honest review if you aare going for this laptop there is a one major problembuild quality of laptop is worse you can even sense when you hold the laptopyeah some peoplemwill say that is gives flexibility and anyother stuff i have been using this laptop since 9months i suggest go for acer or pay more and go for asus best build quality and gives you best look and performancedefinately go for asus
very nice product feeling very happy to work in this laptop its good laptop for both developers and gamers hi mechanical engineering guys its made for you you can do 3d modeling cad hypermesh meshing etc nicely in this laptop
actually looking for a budget gaming laptop then i got this for a budget price and the performance was awesome and display quality is very great but the only con is the low audio output needs to install special drivers or external speakers for high audibilitybattery backup is also very good with the ryzen 5 5600h hexa core processor with 144hz refresh rate absolutely good
performance was great display and sound quality is good when playing heavy games like pubg it needs it requires to connect the charges otherwise game lags and fps drop drastically some people says that the build quality was not good but i really like the overall built quality overall value for money laptop go for it if you want a top notch budget gaming laptop
it is the best experience im feeling after buying this laptop this laptop meets my expectation such a huge base frequency32ghz ram8 gb and ssd512gb all together take less than 10 sec to turn on this laptop dual fan keeps the temperature as low as possible amazing refresh rate144hz and the most important that i like much about this laptop is its graphics nvidia4 gb and amd radeon512 mbim always feels that im lucky because at this price range the laptop is more than i 
nothing extraordinary but nice product which fulfil basic requirements1 super fast boots up in 15 sec2 good build3 coding design softwares works all lag free 4 good to go in 55k bugget
i gifted this to my little brother for hes work this laptop is very fast and well built but the battery life need to improvebut over all this good option to buy specifically ryzen 5 hexa core 5600h go for it
hmm whoever is reading this most probably wants to know if they are investing in a good gaming laptop or not but rest assured this gaming laptop is the best in its price category at the time of writing this review no heating issues good performance ryzen 5 5600h speaks for itself and a good quality display not for content creation though because of low srgb talking about battery thats the weakest part of this machine if youre not gaming putting your performance to battery s
this is my first laptop i got pretty excited on the delivery day after using 2months i am writing this review everything is nice especially i like the keyboard with purple backlight display is fine battery is bad for gaming laptops if you want more battery if you are always far away from charger plug u can avoid gaming laptopsfor gaming still i need to figure it out for programming it was awesome damn sure everylikes it in this budgetfinally it is the killer in this budget
solid gaming laptop for people on a budget love the looks 100fps on most competitive games video rendering times are commendable battery life lasts for 23 hours sturdy built quality
great product i got it on 55k its really if u can get it on this price range or below in future it has a powerful cpu it heats up well while gaming but does not affect your gaming experience fans are great at maintaining temperature value for money but check carefully after delivery for any damage or missing things and yes this is a honest review
just love it definitely go for it whos budget is below 60k i got it for 53 k just 5 days before value for money gta v run ulta smoothly on realistic graphics thermals are also good mind blowing deal 75 fps in gta v is for sure

great specs and amazing performance with 144 ghz refresh rate and for some guys still in doubt about the hinges sound or stability of hinge i dont see any issue with hinge yet the only thing that could have been better is the battery well its a gaming laptop but still could have been better but overall its great within 65k probably the best performance laptop one can get in this budget
writing this review after two days of usage pros performance is top notch if you want a laptop for performance purpose you can go for it built of laptop is decent and design is really good actually it is your preference about what design matters for you weight of the laptop is not that much heavy unlike other gaming laptops it has only 2kg weight display is also goodno issues with it cons actually it has no cons because as it is a gaming laptop these are usual for it like sli
i am using this laptop from past 14 days i was very confused between acer nitro 5 and tuf f15 and this after 2 months of deciding i finally went with this laptop and trust me guys this a very good laptop with this specs and provide value for money u will not regret to buy this laptop only con i found in this are thermals it could have been better but seriously u cant notice that difference overall i am very happy with my purchase
this laptop is best in look and performancelook wise it is very premiumbattery is not upto the mark it last only 3 hours backlit keyboard is just love boots up in 15 sec everything is good at this pricebuilt quality is very good keyboard experience is also goodi got this masterpiece at 57999 in sale you can go for it i will update the review after using it for 1 months
smooth performance great product however added extra 8gb ram and 1 tb hdd plays heavy games like gta 5 asphalt 9 very smoothly smooth browsing experience
writing this review after 2 months this laptop is absolute beast in this price segment rdr2 gta v runs smooth as butter the process is the highlight in this laptop gives desktop like performance if you want to play games use autocad lumion this laptop is for you it is the best in this price segment bought this in bigbillion day backlit keyboard is good has quite a big touchpad its has better airflow design
nice laptop using android studioand programming games all work properly so this is best laptop in budget
great product according to price all rounder laptop at this price point i bought it in sale in 55k i thought its the best time to buy and i ordered it the same day its been 6months using it experience is great i played games for long hours and done many tasks always leave space for air intake to get best performance and while gaming always plugin charger
man i love this laptop it looks so elegant the display is 144hz wled the images and videos look so crisp it is powered by amd ryzen 5600h which is on par or better with i5 10th generation chips of intel the graphics card is nvidia gtx 1650 which can handle almost all games at medium to high graphics settings the best thing about this laptop is its extremely fast boot up speed there are exhaust outlets at the bottom as well as below the screen the only negative thing that i found is
this was my first lappy and im totally satisfied with itits a good lappy for gamingalthough it gets heated quite fast while playing aaa titles if youre not a hardcore gamer then youll like it but then again i play all the aaa titles out there and havent face any problems
if u are looking for mid range gaming laptop and for other stuffs you can go with it iam writing this review after 2 days of delivery performance is awesome battery is good display is also up to the mark finally a good choice iam happy with this laptop
i had purchased the laptop in may got it for rs 54990 then it was it decently great deal the build quality is just average and the battery life is fine for decent usage rest all aspects of this laptop are great considering its price also the above mentioned cons can be ignored for the sole reason 
writing this review after 3 months absolutely value for money product and totally safe and secure delivery by flipkart absolutely happy with their service just one drawback that you cant purchase an extended warranty of 3yrs from hp website as flipkart is not their official partner bt 1yr warranty is there so no need to worry so you can blindly go for it 
an amazing budget gaming laptop can easily run most of the aaa titles performance is great a really good choice for under 60000 gaming laptops definitely worth it
i love it best performancelook is sexy battery backup is low 2 to max 3 hours overall lapy is very nice
best laptop under 55k budget for all your requirementsbattery life is not great but similar like of any gaming laptop around34 hr of continuous use go for it without a single thought
after using 15 days pros performance is good fast refresh rate good looking hp branding cons i cannot customise fans speed and fans automatically high and low even in low intensive work but its battery performance is not so good i have facing over heat issuebut overall its great laptop for high intensive work 45
good product highly recommended for gaming display was smoother than you think battery was good enough to run more than 6 hours in normal usage
a really good all rounder laptop with decent battery backup as well the only down side being the light plastic build quality but still its worth the price coz the performance we get and also considering the good battery life compared to other laptop of this segment and also the speakers are genuinely louder than most laptop
best laptop at this price range pros new ryzen processor decent graphics card 144hz display 500gb ssd cool design etc cons 3hr battery backup poor quality webcam
best in this price point i bough it in 56 k in bigbillion day battery backup is very low for simple work it can go for 4 hour max to max but for edting or gamming please use direct power on charging it get you battery well and performance is top knotch no doubt screen is very smooth 
 great design value for money best display best performance have best look and backlight purple keyboard is also awesome
if you are looking for solely gaming then go for i5 11 gen its better then ryzen 5600h in terms if gaming i have noticed sudden frame drops while playing gta v and others high end gamesframe drops are rare but yeah you will see some jitters while gamingover all the product is okayish performance is avg battery is kinda low although battery doesnt really matters much the only things really good would be its thermals i would suggest u to explore other options as there are better
fantastic machine which hits all the correct checkboxes i am using this for my development purposes and internet surfing the system is speedy however i found the battery backup is a little lower because this will work for 35hrs on the battery than you have to to look for a socket must buy recommended
ssd ram is not brandedhynix ram ssd is installed in it other wise the laptop is good if you just upgrade to good ssd and ram
very nice
awesome laptop great performance really good for editing and gaming
superb in every aspect you can play games at 1080p battery and display us awesome it has an upgaradble ram slot upto 16gb you can extend the storage by using a sata hdd or sata ssd of 25 inch one thing i want to clarify is that although in specs it is written to have wifi version 5 but it actually comes with wifi 6
so far 1 week the experience is awesome
great performanceno heating issuescrystal clear displaygreat adaptor of 150 wattno wobble issue as suchawesome keyboard lookswhat could have been better battery fan makes some soundyou can definitely go for it 
battery capacity is bit low but performance is still great though
got this under 65k in 64k its a great deal performance is good because of ssd its very snapy im a engineering student it fulfills my all needs and in gaming scenario its op because of the gpu and cpu combo at this price range ill inform my gaming performance in details after some more testing and one thing use this laptop for gaming on charging timeit gives more fps
awesome product display quality is really nice it performs as per specs it should be marked as best laptop under 70k no other option in this price tag comes near to this beast a bug thumps up to hp recommended
there exists no competition for this product hp has introduced such a good laptop at such an unexpected price that the complains just diminish by seeing this laptops supremacy 
in my display i found screen bleeding issue

overall better than others brand s 
value for money
loved it storage feels too low but is upgradeble temperature do not hit above 83 c while playing rdr2 it can give you 30 40 fps at ultra settings in rdr2 
by first impression its fast i will update review after 1 week usethank you flipkart for such a instant delivery
great laptop in this price range
i to be specific dont have a problem with the product but the service was worst ever the item got delayed and i had to go physically to the courier warehouse to collect the product worst experience ever
we are satisfied with the product value for money no heating problem battery performance was good delivery was very late
awesome laptop for its price performance is as expected form the processor and gpu no overheating issues if you dont block the vents and keep the laptop cleanhigher refresh rate screens are a gem to use although display quality can be improvedthe only thing that bothers me is having two usb ports instead of threei usually keep mouse and keyboard plugged in and if i want to use a pendrive i have to remove one thing although a usb hub fixes this problem but an extra port wouldve been 
just go for it 
its a pioneer in every aspect and task apart from battery battery lasts for 2 hours to 25 at moderate use go for it if battery aint a concern
this rating is for flipkart not for laptop the worst experience i got while purchasing this laptop delivery delay seller cancellation with out my concern delivery reschedule customer irresponsible behavior evry thing is disappointment but the laptop is good
not bad not bad
battery backup not so good ryzen is very good comparable to i7 10th gen
just osm you get more than u pay 
anyone who is concerned with battery life please update your system even update the additional optional updatesi used to have 12 hrs of battery life and then i updated it now it usually gives me around 45 hrs doing coding and watching youtubeoverall its a nice package screen is smooth but only concern with brightness and also keyboards keys are not visible correctly
so far so good its really value for money i will update my review after some time
great laptop in budget segment
nice product
great product in this price range
overall good device there are minor issues here and their like the battery it is a gaming device so cant complain but still it needs to be charged like every 4 hours or so build quality is good youll feel the smoothness when you use it
my laptop turned off itselfand not turning onmost probably it could be happened by battery failure 
display 55battery 45performance 55design 55value for money 55product is good delivery is worst 
excellent product
screen bleeding issue
really wonder this laptop amazing performance and thermal control with two cooling fans i faced draining battery very quick with 1 he later i updated bios so it now giving 3 to 4 hrs backup in 100 charging also faced issue with warrenty it was started already three months before from i purchased date so i reached hp care and they updated with correct date
bought it for 44k with flipkart axis card in the sale and i can say it is worth every penny the only con i felt is that there is no fan control and battery charging limit like other brands and somewhat less battery life but anyways it is the best laptop if you can buy it under 50k
battery backup is very lessit can run only 3 hours where as it is shown 6 hrs
no one is telling about the built qualitybuilt quality is very poorscrunch sound is coming while lifting the laptopbut performance of the laptop is good and display is also okay
till now i have not faced any technical issues with this laptop earlier i had a doubt with the ryzen processor as compared to intel but after using for 8 months i can tell you that ryzen is going to give tough competition to intel
best laptop in this price range getting 200 on valorant and 100fps on gta5
its super cool laptop for such a priceshould consider to buybut you can check for other alsolike asus tuf easy to use laptopi have compared asus tuf and thisfor me this stands
ultimate
its not even been 3 weeks and battery is draining too fast from day 1 even with minimal usage tried every method but not working battery backup is approx 15 hrs
1display is average i dont know if its me but the display looks grainy and feels below average than my 30k hp laptop which is 3 years old2should have given the battery limit function similar to other companies where we can limit charging to 80 i think its kinda important in a gaming laptop3wifi reception is not good at all i dont know if this is my laptops problem but plz leave a like or something to let me know if u have this kinda problem too4 keyboard is ok my ctrl key w
ive upgraded myself from using a pentium pc to a ryzen 5 5600h you can already guess how happy i am such a beast 
dont buy any product from flipkart it is not returning my laptop it shows error on return option it is hanged till shutdown one day after heating problem
it is wonderful laptop i have been using this for 9 months it is very fast i also added additional 8gb ram as you know windows 11 itself took 4gb ramthe display color is kind of slight yellowish we can change that by adjusting color optimizationgaming is so awesome i was sceptical about tv cut display before purchasing but it turned out so well i like it very much
terrific purchaseplayed gta v valorant both give on max settings 70 170 to 200 fps respectivelyoverall good as of now
great laptop at this price range dont think just go for it 
one of the best in market according to its price
really good laptop for its price performance 1010 i recommend upgrading to 16 gb ram battery more than 45 hrs on normal usage might feel a bit heavy to carry though and the screen wobbles a bit but that wont be a big issue totally recommended 
the laptop is awesome smooth browsing and no lags havent tested the gaming yet but there is instant power dissipation but when you switch to 60 hz from 144 hz the power consumption gets reduced and it gives the battery backup of around 3 hrs on normal usage otherwise if you continue in 144 hz power consumption is more thats the only cons in it the rest is awesome the display processor graphics and all
good product 
got it for 58k and it was best in terms of specs in the range
its the best laptop you can find at this price point the performance is great and can give a battery life of around 3hrs when not in charging
ryzen 5 and 1650 coupled with a 144 hz display makes for the best budget gaming setupi mostly only play csgo so here are some benchmarks for the same1280x960 everything on low except anti aliasing which ks set at 8x gives 200270 fps easily with it touching 300 in some areas of the map1440x1080 almost the samegta 5 gives around 7080 fps on ultra settingscomes with windows 10 but after a few updates you get the option to upgrade to windows 11 for freeoverall a deadly 
really worth buying
just amazing killer performance loved it best for development as of my use 
terrific purchase 100 perfect quality no issues best laptop ever in the segment with the most recent 5600h processor which performs each and every task seamlessly even the updates too better when compared to asus rog msi dell of same segmentboot time just 45 secondsexcellent choice for multitasking150w power adaptor no heating issues included in boxwifi 6 has additional ssd and ram 8 gb slot

this laptop is beast you wont even notice a single frame drop while playing games which are less than 2530 gb

wifi 6 is terrible shows 2 strength signal at 2metre distance from the wifi uses realtek wifi card which is very controversial for gamingframe dropsping spikeshigh ping checked with other laptop have intel ax200 wifi card gives me 4 ms ping without any spike hp pavilion gives 30 40 50 ms and frequent spikes of 100 120 so research about the network connectivity before you buy best choice for the price range and performance that beats i7 11th gen and the 144herts display is just amaz
value for money laptopadvice to gamersto avoid overheating of cpugo to power settings and advanced and reduce the cpu usage to 80while gamingalso try to play game on max settings possible for you with 5060fpsthat will really help you maintain cpu temperature around 6065 ci have played ac valhalla odysseydmc5sekiroforza and everything runs well400 hours of total gameplay on ac valhalla odyssey and i am not facing any issues
serious design issues the purple black contrast on keyboard is terrible unable to clearly or easily view letters on keyboard even with back light on the edge is extremely sharp and caused a cutperformance is decent the screen quality is good it says 300 minutes on the boxits wifi 6 installed 2tb hdd without any problems excepts 2400 mhz ramdo power connector and headphone jack and the opposite sides which i find uncomfortablethat adaptor is getting hot even when the batter
speakers are of no use pathetic
everything is working fine till now1 week only build issue i could see is that hinge is little weak and flutters when used under ceiling fan which is kind of annoying sometimes
overall i buy this laptop to run design software like catia and autoform but its performance is not up to mark
i got it at very low price
got on bbd at an awesome deal of nobody here has posted till now loved it the only drawback is that the battery drains too fast overall its a nice choice 
the features of the laptop are good sound quality is light weight is also light but there is 1 problem running much software at once is heating up
got windows 11 installed june 2022 datedbrightness 300 nits and wifi 6 just go for it in this price it can beat i5 i7 10 th gen star performer first i recieved power button issue but flipkart replaced it for a brand new laptop and have to wait a little bit more because it takes almost 2 month to be replaced but finally got itno concern now at all
delivery sucked but the products is really worth the price
excellent
this laptop is beast in all aspects battery backup is 2 hrs on normal use value for money
i have been using this since 8 months the design is awesome and it shows no problem till now laptop is very good for the person who works on graphics related thingsdesigning people must consider this
this is very good laptop according to mebest in gaming and codingdesign is next level value for 
overall a good laptopthere are some issues thoughthe display is set by default by windows 11 to 125 some windows especially settings windows legacy ones appear a little blurry at 100 the text is too small so at 120 the text appeared less blurry but mcafee could not scale down to this custom scale factorthe keypad is a little different for a click a tap works fine on the keypad but the force required for a deliberate click like on a macbook keypad is comparatively much lesse
good product improve in fast delivery
cons1 body is finger print magnet gets stained easily2 battery life is lesspros1 got it for 58k2 overall serves its purpose it hanged when i first used it such that i had ro turn it off from power button no escape sequence workeddidnt like gaming but i installed csgo to test the performance it is ok
overall nice but built quality could be downfall
cant control fan speed heating too much performance good
battery draining fastits my piece or all like that
overall a good product performancesound and display are pretty good the only problem is the build quality
delivered the product on scheduled time within this price range and configuration wise perfect choice
thank you flipkart for this awesome product
i got this for 60k and its just awesome i loved the performance but since its a gaming laptop battery backup is not that much satisfying still its a good product and value for money
awesome hardware i added 8 gb ram with 1 tb hdd and made it a beast 
best laptop under 60000 i loved it
screen bleed this one ruins everything
bettery performance is too bad
fab just buy additional 8gb ram 3200 mhz to make it even more amazing there is one free slot for ram up to 16gb ram it supports
buy it without any question too fast lappyi am loving it 
very good laptop in this range
expensive but worth every rupee
best performance of ryzen 5 5600h combined with nvidia 1650 144hz for smoother screenplay

just one wordsuperb
awesome laptop to buy in this price range no lagging issues boots up in just 45 secs and heats up very less
its a aweeeeeesome laptop under 60k144 hz display consume more battery give 34 hrs battery backup but ya u can set it on 60 hz to increase battery backupi found very very minute screen bleeding but ya thats normal built quality is also at top notch though its plasticover all its a all rounder laptop u can consider it under 60k

laptop charging slowly and in gta 5 30 fps while game is in its default settings 7 days replacement time is veryless
from the first day giving issue in connecting to wifi first we think that issue is with particular pcs but even after exchange same issue is facing with exchanged one disappointed with this model

batter backups is worst
screen bleeding issue but
prosgood product battery life is fine too especially considering that its a gaming laptop blazing fast performance great display and sound qualitynote comes with a 30 day trial of ms office and mcafee antivirus cons the display is not too sturdy theres creaking noise at times and shakes when the fan speed is high
it fulfils all your need much better than i5 11gen

sexy
it s not good product this price
screen bleeding
one of the best laptop for gaming have been playing some high graphics games and the performance is very smooth you can do multi tasking at ease the only drawback is the battery while gaming you get battery for 3 hours and without gaming it goes higher upto 6 hours rest assured this is a beast and worth the value
laptop is a great deal in the price range worked with premiere pro and adobe photoshop both render and run super smoothly3 month free trail is included for this product this display is greatthe dolby audio is fantastic and the body is metallic finish i dont play games so cant say about itthe battery backup is over 4 to 6 hours in normal use overall a terrific purchase i love it got a wings
i have a soft corner for dell but nowadays dell laptops are too costly to bear after my first time buying an asus laptop i can only say ahh an amazing one its a lightweight creator as well as a gaming laptop the amd ryzen 7 4800h processor is really good it takes 1 15 sec to open from shutdown position the battery backup is quite decent 9 10 hours and the display is just awesomethough it has a plastic body it is a sturdy one not the cheap type and the overall loo

good product
heavy product and good for editing videos
good experiencegood in performance
unbeatable beast
lookwise the laptop is lit its value for money
sound system is not upto the mark
sound is very low compared to my hp laptop i installed all possible drivers no use there was sound distortion when playing forza that is not a deal breaker though as i have paired my portable bluetooth speaker battery backup is about 3 hours laptop heats a bit when playing games but is tolerable rest all is amazing considering the price of 60k inr the ryzen 7 with 16gb ram and 4gb graphic is simply awesome no lag in gaming and laptop boots up under 8 secs
for people who want to know whether the fingerprint is present or not the answer is yes fingerprint sensor is present in the power button

a very good laptop overall for regular use the design and build quality are top notch as always asus has made an excellent machine keeping users in mind the laptop reminds of the old days when laptops used to be bulky and included led indicators for things like power and caps lock the multiple indicators are really helpful especially the red indicators on power button and caps lock look cool the power button shape also gives it a great look the keyboard is as close to a classic keybo
the laptop is pretty amazing in the price range i have played far cry 3 and witcher 3 on it and it processed both of them very smoothly the graphics are also amazingthe things i liked the most are the screen size and the refresh rate both of them makes you love to work on it the keys are also smooth the 90whr battery performs as promised although one major drawback i faced was that sometimes there comes a lag between the audio and video when connected to a bluetooth headset nor

overall performance was good build quality of the product is satisfied battery backup its fully depends upon your works if you are browsing it will come 8 hours if you are watching movie or playing games it will come only 3 hours full hd display was good sound quality just okay design and other things are good but kindly note in this laptop not having lan port 
every this is blazing fast but tn display is not worth it n speakers are average better to go with asus series where you get good package overall

lenovo ideapad slim 3 is good but the only thing is display quality is not so good but also not bad because if you visit alot of white color web pages or white products or you have to work with white screens then this laptop with this display quality is not suitable but over all performance is awesome and processor speed is also very good and the design of laptop is premium look and sound quality is also good there is no complaints with the speed and performance and processor overall a
using this laptop for the past 15 days and i am completely happy with the laptop in performance wise and other aspects ryzen 5 does a brilliant job i am mainly using it for programming purposes including software like r powerbi python mysql and all and it does a good job in it the battery life of the laptop is incredible nearly i am getting a battery life of around 56 on average and it depends on the usage after the first update felt that there is a huge increase in the battery life

worth the price especially with ryzen 5 the absence of a fingerprint sensor is a minor drawback
amazing product every thing is always satisfied i love it
giving this review after 3 day of use it comes with all the features given in the detailsit is running smoothly 45 application togetherbattery backup is upto 56 hours while running continuesly display is average type negetive from downside and whitish from upper side sound quality is good but not so loud other mobile phones have much louder speaker then this no heating issue after heavy use of photoshop autocad flstudio and internet running for 1 hour

features are as expected a good one for basic usage but screen quality could have been better its very thin and need to handle it bit carefully
product is good but lenovo warranty period shows only 22 months remaining

this laptop is the prime example of value for money earlier i was considering to buy acer nitro 5 i5 11th gen and then i saw some reviews and youtube and found out that this ryzen processor is newer and performs better in multi tasking and battery backup is better than the intel counterpart the laptop is very beautiful especially the ultra violet back lit keyboard and the design of this laptop is just so pretty i was lucky enough to cop this laptop even when this was out of stock
incredible buyhave been using it for past 5 daysflipkarts delivery was incredibly fast and appeared before due date in perfect conditioni havent tested gaming though but on a day to day task this machine is a beastyou can through anything at it it will play it with easemy work has been mostly for office usebattery backup is adequate for melooks stunningdont bother to look for any laptop at this price range just go for itwill update the gaming review shortly
overall laptop was so so awesome only the problem is it has less ports compare to other laptops charging also very fast battery backup was good enough as per your use design quality performance 100 fabulous must buy highly recommended you can buy this laptop and additional you can also purchase 1tb or 2tb hdd then alltogether it works faster compare to other models this laptop will worth it with all features
got it today the packaging was great and everything on the outside looks fine the laptop works as smooth as butter just go for it if you need a good laptop with high processing power worth the money will update my review after a weeks usage
the product was really good and best for gamingamd ryzen 5 5600h the processor is beast with 4gb nvidia geforce gtx display with 144hz is awesome156 inches but battery backup is average it should be improved other than that this laptop is best for 60k budget regarding delivery it was delivered within 24 hours really good iam satisfied and this laptop is value for money go for it
i didnt expect wow this is very good laptop and performance is nice and display also good but battery is average but its backup around 56 hrs easily in low brightness in normal uses and gaming aroun 335 but good overall you can buy this laptop its good i will give 5 stars 
in that price range its awesome ssd speed is very fast than imaginelap design is also goodscreen 144hz is nice and quality of screen is very goodbut battery need to improve
excellent delivery great display and refresh rategpu performance not up to the mark but still does the jobexcellent cpu performance and balanced thermalsperfectly runs games like control rdr2 gta online and so on
everything is good if you can grab one hp victus at same price that is more awesomebattery is pretty average but not that badplease note these thingsthere is no ms office with laptop you have pay extra for that type c is just for data transfer no charging support no finger print scanner
lapi is good performance is bestfrom last 7 days i am using it good performance and battery is goodthose who want to play game or use cad software it can be good choice 
this laptop is amazing and no one is comparable to this one in this price range if you want a laptop for gaming editing coding just go for it itll do all the work just as good so far i played valorant 144fps and fornite with 100fps around just got it 2 days back to getting used but will tell as i play more but this one is a beast in its price and offers everything one would need
lets start with the build quality the build quality is very average the laptop leaves finger stains all over its body its really annoying would recommend put on stickers on the body to avoid these finger imprints most important information after buying install and update the lates nvidia graphics drivers when i ran a game i was hardly getting 40fps after updating the drivers i got above 120fps constantly the battery backup was not good not expecting to be good tho it
best product under 65k budget go for itit will not disappoint youbelieve in pavilion the only concern is batterybut that is understandable that it is gaming laptop you cant expect much about battery backlit is just wow bcoz before purchasing i was not sure about how purple backlit would look but after seeing physically it really impressed me 
heres the review after 1 week performance is superb and gives excellent experience display is also superb 144hz gives best experience but if your not a gameing all time change into 60hz it gives some more battery life gaming experience is excellent but if you have to play games you always want to plugged cuz battery for gaming is worst battery is so bad they all said it gives 56 hours but in real normal usage 3 hours gaming 1 hour so bad for gaming 
as a normal user sharing the pros and cons herepros fast bootup it turns on in 10sec and turn off in 4 sec display quality is awesome runs too smoothly beautifully designed with purple backlitbacklit looks great but for the person uses backlit daily can go for white backlit purple is viberant no heating at allcons should have given ms office heavy weight wise plastic on the top of lid is softloose which feels laptop delicate from topi used plastic lamination
great laptop at this price range for studentsim not a gamer if you are a student you can also buy it for android studio or editing videos because it has dedicated gpu pros 1 comes with nvidia gtx16502 144 hz refresh rate3 amd ryzen 5600h better than core i5 12th gen4 display is very good in this segment 5 clean look and also comes under 2 kg of weight which is just insane for gaming laptop others are like 23 25 or 22 kg cons only con is low battery backup lik
writing this review after 3 months of usage1 the performance is ferocious and heavy af the ryzen 5600h is just beast 2 geforce gtx 1650 is very powerful and enough if you are a gaming freak or some 4k editing3 the 144hz refresh rate is just lit4 battery is descent it usually gives me 34 hrs on normal usage5 overall value for money product if your budget allows you then go for this and please dont go with asus tufthe only con is it catches finger prints as it is matt finishe

it meets all my requirements playing valorant and fortnight is fun on this beast the 144hz screen is super smooth and responsive but only problem is with the matt finish it attracts lot of fingerprints and smudges overall at the price its worth it

the laptop is fabulous highly recommendedmy personal opinion1 the performance is awesome would be more better with 16 gb ram but i dont have any problem because the ram is upgradable 2 the battery backup is not good enough for multimedia and movie watchers since it is a gaming laptop so you may not expect more than 5 hours on movies and multimedia but i think since it is a gaming laptop the battery backup is good enoughsince anybody is not gonna play games on the battery3t
100 satisfaction value for money productperformance of laptop is way better than other competitors at this price battery is little bit its minus point but it is a gaming laptop so its considerable it charges rapidly thanks to its 150w adaptor display is crisp clear display size156 144hz you can consider this gaming laptop in this price overall best gaming laptopprocessor ryzen 5 5600h amd radeon 550m integrated graphic card and geforce nvidia gtx 1650 dedicated graphic card
the overall performance of this laptop is goodi checked offline prices of the same laptop which is around 74kthus i bought laptop at 60k online im quite happy with the pricing and this is only laptop available of 5600h series at this price range the only cons is hp should have improved its build quality
best in this priceryzen 5 5600h 144hz screen what else do you needonly con is the battery back up is not much because the processor powerful and screen is 144 hzbut its a gaming laptop so plug in and play absolute beastgames that i tested valorant 200 fps genshin impact 60 fps stablepubg pc 60 fps
laptop is good under 60k is good but screen quality and speaker quality not up to mark there is no base in voice i suggest you to go for lenovo because of camera shutter and good speaker i choose this bcoz of budget and hdd slot msi bravo 15 is amazing but absence of hdd slot thats why i choose this 
this laptop has excellent performance and i used laptop for this 4 months one issue i had found that keyboard r key is not working when i buy this laptop but their hp service is very good day before yesterday they came to our house and change the new keyboard panel and its working fine our home also in a village but they come and fix that issue thank you hponly battery backup comes for 3 to 4 hrs but other than that its very in this offer price
awesome productthe main pros of this product is display crisp and clear look like an olednext thing is very smooth in this price compare with othersthis is beast
i have been using this laptop for last 1 months with external keyboard and mouse and i caught some issues which are 1 something the usb post dont work so i need to interchange the keyboard cable to other usb port and mouse to that usb port2 somethimes the wifi dont know work at all so i need to reboot the laptop this used to happen with my previous laptop also this wifi problemwait for next review
writing this review after 1 week of usageeverything is just awesome good for daily work and gaming no complaints comes with windows 11 home out of the box but doesnt have windows office which is the only fault else it lit and another thing which is lit is the backlit keypad just love it
got it for 54k worth the money processor heating issues not observed but the m2 ssd area gets hot around 60 degrees which maybe normal hence the heat sink processor usually works between 45 and 95 degrees need to add ram for better performance hdd slot available but may need to change stock bracket ad it only support ssd overall good experience
liked the laptop i have a msi gaming laptop i7 16gb the performance of the laptop seems than that of msi the battery back also seems good though i havent played any games on it with music and browsing i am getting 3hrs plus the violet color keyboard doesnt feel so good but its ok

beast performance good audio quality display is also good only battery last for 3 hr so use on adapter while doing heavy tasks thermals are good it dont heat too muchdo no wobble i bought it rather than victus because victus wobble a lotbought it for58490 decent budget but if have no issue with wobble go for victus it has good battery life thermal are also good
it is best gaming laptop things i love in this laptop is its thermal and 144 hz refresh rate display and amd ryzen 5 5600h with gtx 1650
best laptop in this price range i got it at around 54k in big billion days i am a very light user and i have never played any game nor will i try but may be i can try a few cricket games in future display display is good but brightness could have been more 144 hz is very smooth battery i have used it around 2 hours for internet surfing and watching videos and battery decreased from about 55 to 25 percent so thirty percent for two hours seems good maybe gaming will consume m

ryzen 5 5600h is a beast6c 12t best for editing programming and gaming as well nice thermals good build quality though fingerprint marks annoys me sometimes graphics card gtx 1650 is good for decent gaming and can run almost every new generation games in medium settings 40 fps
pros1 good display2 manageable temperatures3 budget friendly value for money cons1 keys are not visible even during the day without backlit on2 performance sometimes throttles for a few seconds while playing gamesconclusion great buy for the price further you can update ram and ssd as well whenever needed
all of the performance of this laptop was literally good but battery is not goodin my opinion this laptop is a beast im very happy with this laptop thankyou flipkartfor giving me this best deal
i am using this laptop from past 14 days i was very confused between acer nitro 5 and tuf f15 and this after 2 months of deciding i finally went with this laptop and trust me guys this a very good laptop with this specs and provide value for money u will not regret to buy this laptop only con i found in this are thermals it could have been better but seriously u cant notice that difference overall i am very happy with my purchase
only cons which were not deal breaker are1 hinge wobbling while typing aggressively or kept right under the fan with 5 speed2 colours displayed on the screen are not vibrant they are dull but you got 144 hz refresh rate so no need to worry3 trackpad height is less bcoz of that speaker grills you can manage it by purchasing a mouse4you can get the battery backup of 35 to 4 hours on light usage if your work is heavy you shouldnt expect a good battery life in a gaming laptop a
all the things are good come with beast processor allthe things are pros cons battery backup is less hinj may get loose faster as her older versions have that problemcomes with massive blotware suggetion if you need performance just buy it blindly and reinstall windows with iso from microsoft website windows license automatic it takes and blotware get removedover all loved the product
ok the laptop is good and its worth buying but look for discounts the thing by which i am not impressed is its sound and battery life it hardly gives you a 4 hr battery life on a normal use and my phones sound is more louder than its sound rest everything is perfect i loved it
honest review if you aare going for this laptop there is a one major problembuild quality of laptop is worse you can even sense when you hold the laptopyeah some peoplemwill say that is gives flexibility and anyother stuff i have been using this laptop since 9months i suggest go for acer or pay more and go for asus best build quality and gives you best look and performancedefinately go for asus
very nice product feeling very happy to work in this laptop its good laptop for both developers and gamers hi mechanical engineering guys its made for you you can do 3d modeling cad hypermesh meshing etc nicely in this laptop
actually looking for a budget gaming laptop then i got this for a budget price and the performance was awesome and display quality is very great but the only con is the low audio output needs to install special drivers or external speakers for high audibilitybattery backup is also very good with the ryzen 5 5600h hexa core processor with 144hz refresh rate absolutely good
performance was great display and sound quality is good when playing heavy games like pubg it needs it requires to connect the charges otherwise game lags and fps drop drastically some people says that the build quality was not good but i really like the overall built quality overall value for money laptop go for it if you want a top notch budget gaming laptop
it is the best experience im feeling after buying this laptop this laptop meets my expectation such a huge base frequency32ghz ram8 gb and ssd512gb all together take less than 10 sec to turn on this laptop dual fan keeps the temperature as low as possible amazing refresh rate144hz and the most important that i like much about this laptop is its graphics nvidia4 gb and amd radeon512 mbim always feels that im lucky because at this price range the laptop is more than i 
nothing extraordinary but nice product which fulfil basic requirements1 super fast boots up in 15 sec2 good build3 coding design softwares works all lag free 4 good to go in 55k bugget
i gifted this to my little brother for hes work this laptop is very fast and well built but the battery life need to improvebut over all this good option to buy specifically ryzen 5 hexa core 5600h go for it
hmm whoever is reading this most probably wants to know if they are investing in a good gaming laptop or not but rest assured this gaming laptop is the best in its price category at the time of writing this review no heating issues good performance ryzen 5 5600h speaks for itself and a good quality display not for content creation though because of low srgb talking about battery thats the weakest part of this machine if youre not gaming putting your performance to battery s
this is my first laptop i got pretty excited on the delivery day after using 2months i am writing this review everything is nice especially i like the keyboard with purple backlight display is fine battery is bad for gaming laptops if you want more battery if you are always far away from charger plug u can avoid gaming laptopsfor gaming still i need to figure it out for programming it was awesome damn sure everylikes it in this budgetfinally it is the killer in this budget
solid gaming laptop for people on a budget love the looks 100fps on most competitive games video rendering times are commendable battery life lasts for 23 hours sturdy built quality
great product i got it on 55k its really if u can get it on this price range or below in future it has a powerful cpu it heats up well while gaming but does not affect your gaming experience fans are great at maintaining temperature value for money but check carefully after delivery for any damage or missing things and yes this is a honest review
just love it definitely go for it whos budget is below 60k i got it for 53 k just 5 days before value for money gta v run ulta smoothly on realistic graphics thermals are also good mind blowing deal 75 fps in gta v is for sure
just got this beast after 5days from orderingthis is the best budget gaming laptop ever as this has the new amd processors ryzen 5 5600h just under 60k range with this gtx 1650 will perform more than you expectedchecked everything after delivery everything was good no problems and tried valorant game for gaming performance it gave 130 fps in high graphicsits the best laptop for students and also who are intrested in gaming under 65k even best under 70k budgetcons screen wobbles whi
great specs and amazing performance with 144 ghz refresh rate and for some guys still in doubt about the hinges sound or stability of hinge i dont see any issue with hinge yet the only thing that could have been better is the battery well its a gaming laptop but still could have been better but overall its great within 65k probably the best performance laptop one can get in this budget
writing this review after two days of usage pros performance is top notch if you want a laptop for performance purpose you can go for it built of laptop is decent and design is really good actually it is your preference about what design matters for you weight of the laptop is not that much heavy unlike other gaming laptops it has only 2kg weight display is also goodno issues with it cons actually it has no cons because as it is a gaming laptop these are usual for it like sli
this laptop is best in look and performancelook wise it is very premiumbattery is not upto the mark it last only 3 hours backlit keyboard is just love boots up in 15 sec everything is good at this pricebuilt quality is very good keyboard experience is also goodi got this masterpiece at 57999 in sale you can go for it i will update the review after using it for 1 months

writing this review after 2 months this laptop is absolute beast in this price segment rdr2 gta v runs smooth as butter the process is the highlight in this laptop gives desktop like performance if you want to play games use autocad lumion this laptop is for you it is the best in this price segment bought this in bigbillion day backlit keyboard is good has quite a big touchpad its has better airflow design
nice laptop using android studioand programming games all work properly so this is best laptop in budget
great product according to price all rounder laptop at this price point i bought it in sale in 55k i thought its the best time to buy and i ordered it the same day its been 6months using it experience is great i played games for long hours and done many tasks always leave space for air intake to get best performance and while gaming always plugin charger
man i love this laptop it looks so elegant the display is 144hz wled the images and videos look so crisp it is powered by amd ryzen 5600h which is on par or better with i5 10th generation chips of intel the graphics card is nvidia gtx 1650 which can handle almost all games at medium to high graphics settings the best thing about this laptop is its extremely fast boot up speed there are exhaust outlets at the bottom as well as below the screen the only negative thing that i found is
this was my first lappy and im totally satisfied with itits a good lappy for gamingalthough it gets heated quite fast while playing aaa titles if youre not a hardcore gamer then youll like it but then again i play all the aaa titles out there and havent face any problems
if u are looking for mid range gaming laptop and for other stuffs you can go with it iam writing this review after 2 days of delivery performance is awesome battery is good display is also up to the mark finally a good choice iam happy with this laptop
i had purchased the laptop in may got it for rs 54990 then it was it decently great deal the build quality is just average and the battery life is fine for decent usage rest all aspects of this laptop are great considering its price also the above mentioned cons can be ignored for the sole reason 
writing this review after 3 months absolutely value for money product and totally safe and secure delivery by flipkart absolutely happy with their service just one drawback that you cant purchase an extended warranty of 3yrs from hp website as flipkart is not their official partner bt 1yr warranty is there so no need to worry so you can blindly go for it 
an amazing budget gaming laptop can easily run most of the aaa titles performance is great a really good choice for under 60000 gaming laptops definitely worth it
i love it best performancelook is sexy battery backup is low 2 to max 3 hours overall lapy is very nice
best laptop under 55k budget for all your requirementsbattery life is not great but similar like of any gaming laptop around34 hr of continuous use go for it without a single thought
after using 15 days pros performance is good fast refresh rate good looking hp branding cons i cannot customise fans speed and fans automatically high and low even in low intensive work but its battery performance is not so good i have facing over heat issuebut overall its great laptop for high intensive work 45
good product highly recommended for gaming display was smoother than you think battery was good enough to run more than 6 hours in normal usage
a really good all rounder laptop with decent battery backup as well the only down side being the light plastic build quality but still its worth the price coz the performance we get and also considering the good battery life compared to other laptop of this segment and also the speakers are genuinely louder than most laptop
best laptop at this price range pros new ryzen processor decent graphics card 144hz display 500gb ssd cool design etc cons 3hr battery backup poor quality webcam
best in this price point i bough it in 56 k in bigbillion day battery backup is very low for simple work it can go for 4 hour max to max but for edting or gamming please use direct power on charging it get you battery well and performance is top knotch no doubt screen is very smooth 
 great design value for money best display best performance have best look and backlight purple keyboard is also awesome
if you are looking for solely gaming then go for i5 11 gen its better then ryzen 5600h in terms if gaming i have noticed sudden frame drops while playing gta v and others high end gamesframe drops are rare but yeah you will see some jitters while gamingover all the product is okayish performance is avg battery is kinda low although battery doesnt really matters much the only things really good would be its thermals i would suggest u to explore other options as there are better
fantastic machine which hits all the correct checkboxes i am using this for my development purposes and internet surfing the system is speedy however i found the battery backup is a little lower because this will work for 35hrs on the battery than you have to to look for a socket must buy recommended
ssd ram is not brandedhynix ram ssd is installed in it other wise the laptop is good if you just upgrade to good ssd and ram
very nice
awesome laptop great performance really good for editing and gaming
superb in every aspect you can play games at 1080p battery and display us awesome it has an upgaradble ram slot upto 16gb you can extend the storage by using a sata hdd or sata ssd of 25 inch one thing i want to clarify is that although in specs it is written to have wifi version 5 but it actually comes with wifi 6
so far 1 week the experience is awesome
great performanceno heating issuescrystal clear displaygreat adaptor of 150 wattno wobble issue as suchawesome keyboard lookswhat could have been better battery fan makes some soundyou can definitely go for it 
battery capacity is bit low but performance is still great though
got this under 65k in 64k its a great deal performance is good because of ssd its very snapy im a engineering student it fulfills my all needs and in gaming scenario its op because of the gpu and cpu combo at this price range ill inform my gaming performance in details after some more testing and one thing use this laptop for gaming on charging timeit gives more fps
awesome product display quality is really nice it performs as per specs it should be marked as best laptop under 70k no other option in this price tag comes near to this beast a bug thumps up to hp recommended
there exists no competition for this product hp has introduced such a good laptop at such an unexpected price that the complains just diminish by seeing this laptops supremacy 
in my display i found screen bleeding issue
performance45battery4display42design4build quality37in this price range there is no other laptop who can compete with this 
overall better than others brand s 
value for money
loved it storage feels too low but is upgradeble temperature do not hit above 83 c while playing rdr2 it can give you 30 40 fps at ultra settings in rdr2 
by first impression its fast i will update review after 1 week usethank you flipkart for such a instant delivery
great laptop in this price range
i to be specific dont have a problem with the product but the service was worst ever the item got delayed and i had to go physically to the courier warehouse to collect the product worst experience ever
we are satisfied with the product value for money no heating problem battery performance was good delivery was very late
awesome laptop for its price performance is as expected form the processor and gpu no overheating issues if you dont block the vents and keep the laptop cleanhigher refresh rate screens are a gem to use although display quality can be improvedthe only thing that bothers me is having two usb ports instead of threei usually keep mouse and keyboard plugged in and if i want to use a pendrive i have to remove one thing although a usb hub fixes this problem but an extra port wouldve been 
just go for it 
its a pioneer in every aspect and task apart from battery battery lasts for 2 hours to 25 at moderate use go for it if battery aint a concern
this rating is for flipkart not for laptop the worst experience i got while purchasing this laptop delivery delay seller cancellation with out my concern delivery reschedule customer irresponsible behavior evry thing is disappointment but the laptop is good
not bad not bad
battery backup not so good ryzen is very good comparable to i7 10th gen
just osm you get more than u pay 
anyone who is concerned with battery life please update your system even update the additional optional updatesi used to have 12 hrs of battery life and then i updated it now it usually gives me around 45 hrs doing coding and watching youtubeoverall its a nice package screen is smooth but only concern with brightness and also keyboards keys are not visible correctly
so far so good its really value for money i will update my review after some time
great laptop in budget segment
nice product
great product in this price range
overall good device there are minor issues here and their like the battery it is a gaming device so cant complain but still it needs to be charged like every 4 hours or so build quality is good youll feel the smoothness when you use it
my laptop turned off itselfand not turning onmost probably it could be happened by battery failure 
display 55battery 45performance 55design 55value for money 55product is good delivery is worst 
excellent product
screen bleeding issue
really wonder this laptop amazing performance and thermal control with two cooling fans i faced draining battery very quick with 1 he later i updated bios so it now giving 3 to 4 hrs backup in 100 charging also faced issue with warrenty it was started already three months before from i purchased date so i reached hp care and they updated with correct date
bought it for 44k with flipkart axis card in the sale and i can say it is worth every penny the only con i felt is that there is no fan control and battery charging limit like other brands and somewhat less battery life but anyways it is the best laptop if you can buy it under 50k
battery backup is very lessit can run only 3 hours where as it is shown 6 hrs
no one is telling about the built qualitybuilt quality is very poorscrunch sound is coming while lifting the laptopbut performance of the laptop is good and display is also okay
till now i have not faced any technical issues with this laptop earlier i had a doubt with the ryzen processor as compared to intel but after using for 8 months i can tell you that ryzen is going to give tough competition to intel
best laptop in this price range getting 200 on valorant and 100fps on gta5
its super cool laptop for such a priceshould consider to buybut you can check for other alsolike asus tuf easy to use laptopi have compared asus tuf and thisfor me this stands
ultimate
its not even been 3 weeks and battery is draining too fast from day 1 even with minimal usage tried every method but not working battery backup is approx 15 hrs
1display is average i dont know if its me but the display looks grainy and feels below average than my 30k hp laptop which is 3 years old2should have given the battery limit function similar to other companies where we can limit charging to 80 i think its kinda important in a gaming laptop3wifi reception is not good at all i dont know if this is my laptops problem but plz leave a like or something to let me know if u have this kinda problem too4 keyboard is ok my ctrl key w
ive upgraded myself from using a pentium pc to a ryzen 5 5600h you can already guess how happy i am such a beast 
dont buy any product from flipkart it is not returning my laptop it shows error on return option it is hanged till shutdown one day after heating problem
it is wonderful laptop i have been using this for 9 months it is very fast i also added additional 8gb ram as you know windows 11 itself took 4gb ramthe display color is kind of slight yellowish we can change that by adjusting color optimizationgaming is so awesome i was sceptical about tv cut display before purchasing but it turned out so well i like it very much
terrific purchaseplayed gta v valorant both give on max settings 70 170 to 200 fps respectivelyoverall good as of now
great laptop at this price range dont think just go for it 
one of the best in market according to its price
really good laptop for its price performance 1010 i recommend upgrading to 16 gb ram battery more than 45 hrs on normal usage might feel a bit heavy to carry though and the screen wobbles a bit but that wont be a big issue totally recommended 
the laptop is awesome smooth browsing and no lags havent tested the gaming yet but there is instant power dissipation but when you switch to 60 hz from 144 hz the power consumption gets reduced and it gives the battery backup of around 3 hrs on normal usage otherwise if you continue in 144 hz power consumption is more thats the only cons in it the rest is awesome the display processor graphics and all
good product 
got it for 58k and it was best in terms of specs in the range
its the best laptop you can find at this price point the performance is great and can give a battery life of around 3hrs when not in charging
ryzen 5 and 1650 coupled with a 144 hz display makes for the best budget gaming setupi mostly only play csgo so here are some benchmarks for the same1280x960 everything on low except anti aliasing which ks set at 8x gives 200270 fps easily with it touching 300 in some areas of the map1440x1080 almost the samegta 5 gives around 7080 fps on ultra settingscomes with windows 10 but after a few updates you get the option to upgrade to windows 11 for freeoverall a deadly 
really worth buying
just amazing killer performance loved it best for development as of my use 
terrific purchase 100 perfect quality no issues best laptop ever in the segment with the most recent 5600h processor which performs each and every task seamlessly even the updates too better when compared to asus rog msi dell of same segmentboot time just 45 secondsexcellent choice for multitasking150w power adaptor no heating issues included in boxwifi 6 has additional ssd and ram 8 gb slot
battery backup is ok but performance is superbsounds is also good screen refresh rate is awesome youll love gaming e sports in it
the speaker of one side is not working properly
1 wifi at distance lp can not get full range however my other dell lp gets full range2battery drains in quickly just for browse however it get full charge immediately at least it should last for 4 hr 3 smooth performance4 ac adaptor get heated in 5 mins
good product
great product
10 times better than i5 10 gen
super performance
this is the best
this laptop is beast you wont even notice a single frame drop while playing games which are less than 2530 gb
wow superrrr performance it comes with win 11
laptop is very nice with very fast delivery all softwares are running very smoothlyheavy games are also loading in very less timeworth for money battery backup 56 hours with normal use and 34 hours while gamingbest laptop in this range
awesome product
wifi 6 is terrible shows 2 strength signal at 2metre distance from the wifi uses realtek wifi card which is very controversial for gamingframe dropsping spikeshigh ping checked with other laptop have intel ax200 wifi card gives me 4 ms ping without any spike hp pavilion gives 30 40 50 ms and frequent spikes of 100 120 so research about the network connectivity before you buy best choice for the price range and performance that beats i7 11th gen and the 144herts display is just amaz
value for money laptopadvice to gamersto avoid overheating of cpugo to power settings and advanced and reduce the cpu usage to 80while gamingalso try to play game on max settings possible for you with 5060fpsthat will really help you maintain cpu temperature around 6065 ci have played ac valhalla odysseydmc5sekiroforza and everything runs well400 hours of total gameplay on ac valhalla odyssey and i am not facing any issues
serious design issues the purple black contrast on keyboard is terrible unable to clearly or easily view letters on keyboard even with back light on the edge is extremely sharp and caused a cutperformance is decent the screen quality is good it says 300 minutes on the boxits wifi 6 installed 2tb hdd without any problems excepts 2400 mhz ramdo power connector and headphone jack and the opposite sides which i find uncomfortablethat adaptor is getting hot even when the batter
speakers are of no use pathetic
everything is working fine till now1 week only build issue i could see is that hinge is little weak and flutters when used under ceiling fan which is kind of annoying sometimes
overall i buy this laptop to run design software like catia and autoform but its performance is not up to mark
i got it at very low price
got on bbd at an awesome deal of nobody here has posted till now loved it the only drawback is that the battery drains too fast overall its a nice choice 
the features of the laptop are good sound quality is light weight is also light but there is 1 problem running much software at once is heating up
got windows 11 installed june 2022 datedbrightness 300 nits and wifi 6 just go for it in this price it can beat i5 i7 10 th gen
delivery sucked but the products is really worth the price
excellent
this laptop is beast in all aspects battery backup is 2 hrs on normal use value for money
i have been using this since 8 months the design is awesome and it shows no problem till now laptop is very good for the person who works on graphics related thingsdesigning people must consider this
this is very good laptop according to mebest in gaming and codingdesign is next level value for 
overall a good laptopthere are some issues thoughthe display is set by default by windows 11 to 125 some windows especially settings windows legacy ones appear a little blurry at 100 the text is too small so at 120 the text appeared less blurry but mcafee could not scale down to this custom scale factorthe keypad is a little different for a click a tap works fine on the keypad but the force required for a deliberate click like on a macbook keypad is comparatively much lesse
good product improve in fast delivery
cons1 body is finger print magnet gets stained easily2 battery life is lesspros1 got it for 58k2 overall serves its purpose it hanged when i first used it such that i had ro turn it off from power button no escape sequence workeddidnt like gaming but i installed csgo to test the performance it is ok
overall nice but built quality could be downfall
cant control fan speed heating too much performance good
battery draining fastits my piece or all like that
overall a good product performancesound and display are pretty good the only problem is the build quality
delivered the product on scheduled time within this price range and configuration wise perfect choice
thank you flipkart for this awesome product
i got this for 60k and its just awesome i loved the performance but since its a gaming laptop battery backup is not that much satisfying still its a good product and value for money
awesome hardware i added 8 gb ram with 1 tb hdd and made it a beast 
best laptop under 60000 i loved it
screen bleed this one ruins everything
bettery performance is too bad
fab just buy additional 8gb ram 3200 mhz to make it even more amazing there is one free slot for ram up to 16gb ram it supports
buy it without any question too fast lappyi am loving it 
very good laptop in this range
expensive but worth every rupee

prosgood product battery life is fine too especially considering that its a gaming laptop blazing fast performance great display and sound qualitynote comes with a 30 day trial of ms office and mcafee antivirus cons the display is not too sturdy theres creaking noise at times and shakes when the fan speed is high

sexy
it s not good product this price
screen bleeding
one of the best laptop for gaming have been playing some high graphics games and the performance is very smooth you can do multi tasking at ease the only drawback is the battery while gaming you get battery for 3 hours and without gaming it goes higher upto 6 hours rest assured this is a beast and worth the value
backlit keyboard not working some keys dont glow properlyspecially the delete keywant to replace
dont buy poor built quality back panel of the laptop is loosely fit and sound is coming duringvusage

cons fingerprint magnet
good gaming laptopbut battery life is aokay not great nor goodfast charging thanks to 150watts charging brickdisplay is good but brightness could be more brightyou re going to suffer if you are using your laptop in sunlight
best laptop in this range
5600h best processoryou can go for this model without any doubt
best laptop for this price point go for it with your eyes closed
price worthy it is best among all ryzen 5 or intel 5 laptops this ryzen 5 hexa core 5600 can also compete and beat intel i7 10th gen

best performance better thermal good quality materials use
really a nice laptop all the specifications are top notchone thing that is a bit troublesome is the backlit keyboardkeys are only visible clearly when the backlit is onfor coding purposes it might not be the best
super fast laptop
 laptop adapter is not working after 7 months which cost me around 5000 i am disappointed 
bought it for heavy softwares and it is working smooth loved it totally
first day experience is good i will update my review after 1 months 6 months and 1 year
brightness level very low
good performance packed budget friendly laptop
awesome my first gaming laptop loving it
best laptop in this priceperformance is very fastboot time is 57 secondsbettery is little smaller for this processorsbettery backup is 34 hrs for normal use
got this at 59k in big billion days my experience till nowdisplay amazing display and butter smooth with 144hz no screen bleeding or dead pixels910battery i got 4 hrs from 87 to 15 when i was browsing and downloading windows in the background and valorant with 50 brightness i checked its battery health and it was 100910performance stellar this machine can run valorant or gta5 with 90 fps which is awesome1010camera average 610 but it will get the things donek
awesome product
the only problem with my device is that one key doesnt have backlightit is a good device but the on board storage is rather lowbut the good thing is that its expandableoverall a good purchase
battery performance is a big issue in this laptop model normal usage is consuming so much battery power when i have not played a single only giving 25 hrs backupi would say for a new laptop its very low overall laptop is okay hp should work on its battery 
the best processor you can get in this price range i think the minimum brightness should be a bit lower temperature management is fine keyboard letters are hard to see without backlight
best lap under given price
never buy hp laptops or anything of hp its worst than anything worst coustomer support coustomer excuitive have zero knowledge they just try to tollerate your problem because they have no knowledge i am suffering from 5 months with my this laptop no support from hp although its in warranty so never buy any product of hp

overall the product is quiet good display is good love the keyboard nice build no issues till now
definitely the best if your budget is under 55k i got it for 52k during the big billion day sale i thought of going for hp pavilion with ryzen 5 5600 which is better processor compared to ryzen 5 4600 but the hp pavilion design and keyboard colour looks dull and unattractive i am very satisfied with this laptop everything is fine till now i have been using it for 5 days i will provide the full review after a couple of months battery is good considering a gaming laptop gives me ar

value for money laptop battery backup is low but thats expected from a gaming laptop bought a 512 nvme ssd and 8 gb 2933 sodimm ram during the sale and upgraded the laptop gaming has improved by a lot after ram upgrade
i loved the product the exterior look of the laptop is amazing the performance is great but the battery backup is upto 23 hours if you are doing some work whereas it consumes more when you are playing games till now i am not facing any problem if you want a high performance laptop for gaming or programming and budget friendly go fo it

from past 10 months im searching for a best gaming laptop today i found it and i can say my choice is perfect mindblowing gaming laptop at a reasonable price very fast bootingwith in a blink of eye many people have a dream to become a gamer but due to high price everyone cannot afford a gaming laptop but msi made it possible with this low price and high specifications without any second thought we can buy it i had a few doubts about the laptop and msi customer service cleared all
first of all thanks to flipkart and msi for providing such a machine at 59k during sale perioddisclaimerim a professional editor and my review will based on productivity usage and not gamingive been using this laptop for about a month now and during the period ive used it in many scenarios such as on location during shoot for basic data transferring and proxy creation to editing rough cuts while travelling in a train and overall i love this laptop for the price i bought it i can
great product by msi at a steal price will run most of current aaa titles at high or mid settingspros best deal for its pricertx 3050hexa core i5 10500h2 year warranty great optimization by msi light weight is a add on advantage for studentsall of that for 58k is rare to findcons cant ask more for the price but battery life improvement and a rgb backlit would be appreciatedoverall happy with the purchase
i needed the best performance and a good display at budget and i guess i have made a very nice decision this thing is a beast gaming and 1080p video editing is such a delight in this machine well done msi 
this is a great gaming laptop i m not a hardcore gamer but it suits my needs if you re looking for a casual gaming laptop that preforms as well as the more expensive brands this is a great pick the graphics are crisp sound quality is better than i expected and it connects easily with headphones and wireless mouse i would recommend a full size keyboard for the laptop
first look review will update more latergot this in bbd sale at 59k looks good 144hz display is quite good512gb ssd is not enough so needs additional hddram is expandable upto 64gb basic msi softwares that are included are good tootested with basic games like csgo and valoboth ran smoothlyno heating issues as such on first looku can go for it if ur budget is tight nd want to explore ray tracing 186kg for a gaming laptop is lit tbhif u dont ve issues with servicing u
received this just a few hours back the things i noticed after some light usage like browsing and installing applications arepros 1 ssd is fast ive used only hdd before so this was the first thing i noticed2 temperatures are usually 60c for both gpu and cpu for light use note that this has only one fan but it is unbelievable how cool this system stays even in no air conditioning rooms3 pretty lightweight just marvel at how much this is packing but in so little spacecons1
who and why if your budget around 65k you need laptop for daily work studies and occasional gaming 720p 1080p enough power for multitasking 6 cores 12 threads good looks medium work load can run vms docker integration servers etc i am not talking full prod environment but you can present pocs video editing is possible 1080p v easily can do almost anything 4k u can do basic if you add multiple layers then timeline will lag games tested skyrim special ed
after testing 3 daysmy points of viewspros1 gamings performance is so good considering price you will not find the same performance laptop in this range 2 crispy display3 advanced bios by msi for overclock on software side its really good you will get the other preloaded msi apps which i find useful for day to day task4 chasis is good thin and elegantcons1 power cord port should be in back it is in left side of laptop2 single fan but thermal is goodconsiderin
the machine is quite powerful and runs aaa titles upto 2018 effortlessly for normal usage i dont stream or have massive external monitors so cant say much about those scenarios but if youre looking for a machine that does what it says by its own hardware this is a simply a great investment also runs cadcnc software no problemone heads up do not install the latest nvidia drivers from the nvidia website only download if needed the recommended nvidia drivers from the msi websi
one of the best laptops got it on sale and couldnt hope for anything better the battery is a little bit on the lower side but the display performance sound and the freedom to tweak the settings as per consumers requirement is just amazing the build quality is fantastic though there can be smudges i was quite skeptical about the fan sound but it isnt too much as several other reviews have said also on using headphones you wont hear any disturbance from that gaming and productivity
works effortlessly in most of the aaa titlesplayed rdr2 ac valhalla and it gave stable 4050 fps on medhigh settings battery backup and thermals could have been better otherwise a great deal at under 60k
im not gamer i purchased this lappy for my editing purpose till now its quit fair at this price value for money getting heat little bit during premier but thats fineperformance is quit good with this specification and the best part is it comes with 2yr warranty as msi known forim using from last one week and happy with that
144hz screen with a super fast ssd and a backlit keyboard along with a rtx 3050 is satisfying enough already but the thermals were a huge surprisei played some demanding games and that too at ultra settings for checking gpu throttling but the temps remained as if i was playing valorant under 80 degrees at all times the idle temp was also super chill at around 50 degreesthe games i tested were gta 5 control plague tale innocence all at ultra although for the best frame rates notch it
super fast and looks classy performance oriented machine loved it 
premium for sure in reality its looks way more cooler than in image value for money product msi has done great job at optimization display amazing speaker are clear and louder than most other laptop well i loved it performance is like a beast build quality top notch thats it for now i got this laptop today
i got that laptop during the sale i got it at 59k which is absolutely bang for the pricelets talk about laptop 1 great gaming experience provider2comes with rtx 3050 graphic card which is extremely amazing for gamers3it has ips level display at 144hz refresh rate4comes with backlight keyboard and much morei fully suggest u just go for it
everything works great i am basically using autocad 2023 runs smoothly no problem capable for running high graphics games overall good experience
ordered it on 852022 for 61kincluding card offers got it in three days it came with windows 10 but as soon as i booted it up i got windows 11 update and its performing smooth with it and the connectivity options to your phone transfer and accessing data is very much easier sadly no ms office full version i like the option of enabledisable webcam with function keythe build is plastic and weight is much lighter for a gaming laptop the given 8gb ram 512 gb ssd 450 gb available
though this machine is good but have a drawback it has only dedicated graphics card output if something went wrong with graphics card then display will not work on igpu in todays era most of the laptops have graphics switchable from igpu to dedicated and vica versa it help in long battery backup and laptop usability in case of dedicated graphics card fails

its the best laptop ive ever seen and used i glad and grateful to buy this laptop and be a member of msi community 
just go for it if your budget is below 65kthis is the best you can get i got it for 587 k in big billion saledont expect battery to withstand hours of work but for 3hours max after full charge always connect the charger remove it unless its necessary other than this con its fantastic to work on programming languages such as pythonsql and ms office which im working on currentlyno lagsstutters or annoying things like device brick or errors win11 is awesome which is legal given with t
the product is so good so fare giving a pretty decent performance at this price range you cant find a better laptop in this price segment as i am using it always plugged in i havent faced any lag issues i would suggest msi to improve thermals because while heavy gaming gta temperature rises a little bit
best and perfect since this is a gaming laptop use it while using an external laptop cooling pad which is available online design is very cool and classy more than images and performance is best i totally recommend it
gifted this to my brother and touchwood its going fine till now hopefully everything is well as of now was really sceptic as i have never placed anything online that too an expensive thing well done flipcart
let me start by saying this is not my first gaming laptop this is the 3rd gaming laptop in my family and the second msi laptop in my family have a asus rog g551jk which was my 1st gaming laptop then a msi gp75 leopard 9se485in which was bought in dec 2019 because of which i decided to go for another msi laptop which is this laptop msi gf63 thin i5 with rtx pros1this laptop is a beast i am able to run all the latest games without any problems the performance of the laptop is aw
great laptop bought it for 63k on sale cpus great gpu could have been better if it used more than 40 watt battery not great 3 hour backup on all battery saving options on its using hynix 8gb 3200mhz ram which is sadly clocked at 2933mhz bought another 3200mhz 8gb ram for it it has kingston nvme m2 ssd dont know why fps is low on valorant avg 140 fps intel has done a good job on this 10500h cpu it took me 2 hours and 6 minutes to install red dead redemption 2 dodi repack ov
been using for almost 10 hours right now satisfied with the performance but the fans are noisy when youre using gpu too much like i was testing the raytracing with minecraft for raytracing and the fan sound went very high otherwise its a great purchase
this is a good laptop 512ssd8gb ram4gb rtx graphics are the best in the sell price go for it but the only problem is with fun and heating issue if you can manage it it is the best offer at 63k
very good laptop wouldnt say its recommendable to purchase it for sole reason of traveling as battery backup is not something best out there if you want a good battery backup go for a work focused laptop probably dell or hp i saw people not considering this after hearing its tgp which is frankly low when you see the card used but trust me i have been using it for almost 9 months now and can tell u it didnt affect performance i play valorant on it and i can play it on 144fps thanks
good product at this price but it heats a lot while playing games now its even upgraded to win 11
powerful but battery backup is not up to the mark can handle most of the games at high setting though upgrading the ram would be a good idea overall i am very satisfied with the performance and display only two things that are stopping me from giving it 5 stars are battery backup and body of the laptop which easily gathers finger prints
one of the best machines of msi i use this laptop for my data science projects and all the developer apps work flawlessly it is highly recommendedprosa it weighs under 2kgb hexacore processor 6c 12tc ram upgrade options available to up to 64gbd 144 hz refresh rate screen and ips level displaye dedicated shortcut key for the camera where one can disableenablesecured the camera in no timef temperatures are well maintainedconsa only redcolored keyboard no r
an excellent value for money upgradable only ram storage gaming laptop 144hz refresh rate a geforce rtx graphics card 10th gen i5 hexacore 12 threads processor what more do you want at this priceoh and also the design is pretty slick with impressive build quality
have you ever watched the movie beauty and the beast well this laptop by msi is a beauty as well as a beast i510500h along with the rtx 3050 4gb graphics works as smooth as butter as the i51500h has 6cores and 12 threads there wont be any bottleneck issues we get a 144hz refresh rate screen that too with an antiglare display with 45 ntsc color gamut at this price its more than enough the webcam could have been improved a bit but well a lot of gaming laptops are doing away w
best laptop in both price and perfermance in 63k it was really a very good opportunity to buy this during big billion days really rtx 3050 gives a beast power to this finally happy to buy this
the laptop is good in this price point of 62k the performance is really goodeverything is good except the battery at battery saver mode also it cannot work for more than 2 hoursso always have to hook with the power plug
one of the best laptop at this price range144hz will nail it battery backup is normal cant expect more on gaming laptop with these awesome features cooling is awesome in this once it gets heat it will get cool soo quick graphics are ultimate in this weight is good performance is overall awesome 
very much value for the bucks product its super fast and except the fact that gpu is only 40w i havent found much of a con with this product suggesting you all to upgrade the ram to 16 gb and same with ssd also it comes with a 512 nvme you can purchase a 25inch ssd
one of the best out there in this price pointmake sure to add an extra ssd or else you will run into storage issuei would also recommend for 16gig ramthe performance is butter smooth so far i have tried valorant warzone ark read dead redemption and fifa 19 you can play with out any lags or glitches and the thermals are pretty good considering the price point i will recommend it for sure its a deal breaker at 56k use credit card for extra 3000 off
one of my best purchases till dateabsolute beast around 56 hrs of battery backup on normal usage despite the fact of it being a game centric lappyi am not a big gamer but i played valorant on this baby and oh good lord this thing delivers constant 220 fps epic speaker sound couldve been a little louder but i really dont use it much coz i prefer headphones display is absolutely gorgeous and more than enough brightkeyboard backlit level is also adjustablecamera is me
glad to purchase this one first its looks unique and exclusiveeveryone ask which laptop is this not known upgradable as well like in storage and ram heating is minor depends upon your room temprature as well recommend you go for cooling pad as wellinbuilt speakers are sufficient but not loud inbuilt microphone works 45 camera quality is good 455edit after using some while ago i have to upgrade its ssd and ram then its working smoothly and fine
this is awesomethis is my first laptopand i choose msi because my friends suggested me and it is also most trusted brandand i5 6core rtx 3050 gpu is a beast in this price range and is a very affordable laptopno other laptop will come closer to this in this price rangegaming performance is also totally satisfiedi recommend this laptop to all types of work good work msi 
first off all the delivery was fast and perfectdid all performance and basic tests everything came out just goodi5 10th gen especially 10500h is great with the best single core score compared to other competitors at the same price range and may be abovertx at this price even though its 40w it outranks other gtx variant at this price range with ray tracing and dlss optionthe only thing i was concerned about is the thermal but with the cooler boost 3 on it gives me steady clock speed
amazing laptop at a good budget price pointpros1 great display 144hz really brings out the crispness in image quality2 rtx 3050 this is a powerful gpu that was able to run cyberpunk 2077 at high settings3 i5 10500h is powerful processors and can handle all games easilycons ram is only 8 gb at 65k they could have given us 16 or 12 gb ramprocessors heat up to 85 and sometime 89 celsius
the performance is smooth and the compact form factor is awesomeeasy poratabilityvery good for playing csgovalorant and dota 2u could add extra ssd and ram from msi service centre onlyorelse the warranty will be voidedregister the product at msi website as soon as u get the hands on itscreen is awesomesound is goodheat dissipation is decent40 watt tgpu rtx 3050performs more than expectedsimply go for it and save some extra bucks
all i see is a grt machine light weighted super fast hexa core i must say surely need a little hdd or ssd update because space kinda runs low after some time and it does need a power connection soon as you start playing game battery lasts good while doing normal usage but is gone super fast as soon as u start playing game and the only thing i hated is that the system starts using integrated graphics when the battery runs under 30 and turns off the rtx otherwise the machine doesnt 
one of the best gaming laptops out there in this price range and no you need not be a gamer for this laptop to suit your needs its heavy duty processor and graphics ensure that it can handle your daily multitasking gaming and core intensive softwares with ease go with it if better display and performance are your topmost requirements and all this without not burning a hole in your wallet
best in this price range
best laptop for the price very good performance and thermal managementthe cinebench score is very good geekbench score is also goodssd speed is very fastgames run very smooth thanks to the rtx 3050overall this is unbelievable at its price range i will give a 55 in every waythis is a portablepowerhouseperformer
light weight rtx 3050 best in its range
i literally loved the product at the price point i have bought it during bbd i just found one issue with my charger it produces little bit earthing an as laptop is also made up of metal it feels little earthing like touch all over may be i can live with it
i loved this laptop the performance is really amazing with so low price i am using this laptop for almost 3 weeks now and till now i havent encounter any problem the rtx 3050 even though 40w performs really well
there is no doubt about the laptop but in some games iam getting lower fps then gtx 1650 main valorant other than that laptop is awesome
this pc is beast at this prize
great laptop at this price range only problem is that the battery is not good even for simple usage could have given 1 tb of storage instead of 500gb 500gb is what you get for a low pricespec laptop but performance wise love it
worth it
i bought this at 58k during bbd sale and it justified the pricein the said price range it is very competetive and affordable machine ill list the areas which i feel could be improved later in the review1 144hz monitor awesome2 it is very light3 build quality is ok does not feel cheap4 thermals as soon as cpu temp reaches 80 it comes down automatically same is for gpu too but the temperature threshold for gpu is above 80 degree celsius heat will not be noticed while p
looking nice
fabulous 
awesome laptop but battery backup could be better
overall great performancenice for gaming and other routine workdisplay is awesome
been using this for 2 months and i have to say this is pretty excellent laptop in this price pointonly cons i had is with battery backup min 3hrs when keyboard light is off and 50 brightness and keeping this laptop clean its a finger print magnet apply a skin or else it will bother you
good performance nice product
super laptop
awesome 
looks fantastic lightweight nd very user friendly
what to say im totally satisfied with price and performancewas waiting to buy an msino comments
perfect beast 
sooooo good
the best budget gaming laptop rtx 3050i5 10500h8gb ram512gb ssd144 hz screen refreshedthis is budget gaming laptop all overthank you flipkart and msi
its price worthyeverything is good at this price range its a beast 
fantabulous rtx on 
nice laptop with rtx3050 dont think of 40 tgp you will get awesome fps during gaming heating is a problem usually on the upper side of the keys 
no need to worry about to buy this laptop 
best laptop in 5560k
value for money
such an excellent piece of machinery i will definitely say that this is just best in this price range it does all the normal day to day tasks easily and when it comes to gaming its damn good and with the help of msi dragon center software you could tweak the performance and cooling accordingly which brings out the beast out of the i5 6 core processor the gpu
this is one of the best designs when it comes to upgradability it supports double sided nvme drives so you can easily upgrade it to 2tb gen 4 drives or beyond also it will clock down to 2933mhz if you place a 3200mhz ram tested it with 2x 32gb 3200mhz micron ram
battery gets discharged quickly but overall it is value for moneyif u get in under 60k it worth itin this price range this is the only laptop to come with gpu 3050overall good experiencethanku msi
pretty good laptop at this price but thermals could be better
awsome laptop in this price point very very smmoth and fast laptop
perfect
amazing
i am totally satisfied with this laptop i could ask for more in this price range i compared my friends laptop which he bought for 90k and my 60k laptop rivalled it soo how can i complain but the build quality could be better if i paid some more but performance is too notch
best in this price
no cons this is beast in price segment someone think about tgp of rtx 3050 is low but guys i tell that it perform even well that 75 watt tgp nitro
it has been a month and its working smoothly
the best laptop in the budget everything is the best but battery is just good
good
best in this price rangebest thing is the weight of it excellent sound quality16gb ram would better for this system
the screen is amazing you cant compare with another laptop but battery is not good as per my usage only i have got battery issue and everything is good
a go grab it product 
gaming performance is really good but if you are looking for a battery backup get yourself something else its functions and built is really good

add more 56k to your budget and buy some other rtx 3050 laptop this one has only 40 watt and only one fan so it heats alot and u might face cpu throttling and the display is average

butter smooth gamming experience on every game make sure to switch to nevia gup otherwise game will playing in intel integrated graphics
good product fast gpu also work hdmi you can play high refresh rate game on supported external monitor
in this price range it is absolutely best ith has rtx 3059 there nothing else to say
got this beast at 60k its damn fast and responsive msi is the best 
it is a great product i only saw temprature reaching high about 70 to 80 while playing heavy games would have loved if it would have dual fan but then in this price range this is more than money can bye 
best for the price
extremely worth of buying
nice
nice product but requires cooling pads for long life
this would be a 10 if more memory was available playing graphics heavy aaa games can sometimes be challenging if too many applications are open i would recommend upgrading the memory to 16 gb for better performance other than this minor issue the laptop works fine
ok its been 10 days i have got it this is very good laptop only issue in this laptop is battery u need charger where ever u go and performance and other things good
best rtx laptop in this price
this is a very powerful laptop with amazing processing speed

good product 
charger wire is a bit loose from adapter i contacted customer support for that but they were asking for both laptop and charger to fix it did anyone else also face the same issue with charger 
simply perfect
very good performance
good product but little high cost
the device is really fast and snappy it can handle almost all the softwares smoothly installed windows 11 on this device recently and i must say performance and display quality is great it could have done better in battery department but this is expected from a gaming laptop although it has lowest tdp rtx 3050 gaming experience has been smooth till now i have played rocket league and fifa 21 there i was getting more than 100 fps keyboard red colour could have been better
love it super
good product 
excellent budget gaming laptop
its a wow material
good as expected
fantastic go for it
the laptop is surprisingly capable for the intended tasks of gaming mid and high end games even though it has a lower watt rtx 3050 gpu though it has only one fan it makes up by providing options of cooler booster which does its job very well it is well priced and good looking it is a bit of a finger print magnet but that is not a major issue

bought this product some weeks ago and i am just loving it i did a lot of editing and gaming on this beast and it easily handles each task i recommend u all to upgrade ram for better performance gr8 work msi 
good laptop with worst battery backupits heat going beyond when u paly any kind of game service support is carry in is another drawback battery drain very fast i backup is only 2 hours
msi gf63 i5 10 gen rtx 3050 is good laptop at that price they are providing fitting part for future expansion ram and ssd it is provide true gaming experience keyboard and touchpad are excellent it gives experience of using macbook i am loved with msi dragon center where we monitor user laptop condition overall experience is very good
at this price the best laptoo 
itsa awsome product from msi considering little bit heatingthe laptop was out of the mark i really loved it also customer support and build quality is very nice
overall great product in price range
great product by msi144hz displayrtx 3050red backlit keyboard i know many people think it hurts your eyes during night but works fine for mei would have preferred an amd cpu but it will work since its a 6core i5it can run a lot of new titles smoothly at medium settingsits a great deal in this price segmentsit looks cool dont expect much battery in a gaming laptopsound is good for a laptop2 years warranty at no extra cost is quite a clutch for final decision making
need a ram upgrade for smooth gaming
great for its price also pretty light weight for a gaming laptop satisfied with the purchase buy it if you get this under 65k without thinking twiceedit after 3 months of usestill working great survived tea spill over keyboard only downside is the red backlit keyboard whitebluegreen wouldve been better red is too harsh on eyesalso the battery is not that good8 months of usestill working great no issues whatsoever you cam trust msi

its a perfect beauty and a perfect gaming machine at this price rangethe only thing thats annoying are that some keys in my laptop are slightly sunk
good job msi
everything is perfectly fine it works well but the outer meterial of the laptop is not as expected
best product in budget of 63k gaming coading at the top level
performance i was able to play games likes valorant and cs flawlessly so no issues heating every gaming laptop heats so keeping that in mind the thermals were good the only thing i would like them to improve is speakers theyre good but i expected them them to be a bit louder concluding its a good laptop at this price point you can go for it
just want to tell you best at its price the beast it is 
the product is good and delivers what it promises only one issue is that it has single fan setup while in product description it states it has dual fan setup also the chasis heat up a bit on the escape key part overall the product is excellent and best value for money it is light and has good build quality and best value for money laptop
used for 23 days performance is great display is awesome ram is less but its upgradeable cpu and gpu are perfectly matched in performance so they dont bottleneck each other battery life is good for a gaming laptop although i wouldnt recommend gaming on batteryfactory seal is big down point because without breaking that one cannot perform any upgrades this is a very negative point for msi as its known for gaming laptops so they should be easily upgradableall in all a good valu

good performance
very good product
battery backup is 35 hours in normal mode 15 hour in gaming little bitt heating issuesperformance is exceptional i think its better to go this this laptop because of 3050 rtx graphic card it is significant better than the gtx series cards in terms of feature3050 rtx is 10 better than 1650ti
this is the one i was looking for best performance as well as qualityloved it and above all giving me the best gaming experience
nice laptop with value for money specifications
if you are looking for a budget gaming laptop then this is the best pick in this segment

everything is vey very good getting rtx at this price was so damn lucky i bought at last big billion days till now no issues i played aaa games like valorant gta 5 resident evil 6 at high graphics no lag till now but the only problem is gpu usage is low if we make that gpu to use more this will be beast i completely recommend it can anyone know to boost gpu usage kindly mention

the overall performance of this laptop is goodi checked offline prices of the same laptop which is around 74kthus i bought laptop at 60k online im quite happy with the pricing and this is only laptop available of 5600h series at this price range the only cons is hp should have improved its build quality

laptop is good under 60k is good but screen quality and speaker quality not up to mark there is no base in voice i suggest you to go for lenovo because of camera shutter and good speaker i choose this bcoz of budget and hdd slot msi bravo 15 is amazing but absence of hdd slot thats why i choose this 
this laptop has excellent performance and i used laptop for this 4 months one issue i had found that keyboard r key is not working when i buy this laptop but their hp service is very good day before yesterday they came to our house and change the new keyboard panel and its working fine our home also in a village but they come and fix that issue thank you hponly battery backup comes for 3 to 4 hrs but other than that its very in this offer price

writing this review after 1 week of usageeverything is just awesome good for daily work and gaming no complaints comes with windows 11 home out of the box but doesnt have windows office which is the only fault else it lit and another thing which is lit is the backlit keypad just love it
got it for 54k worth the money processor heating issues not observed but the m2 ssd area gets hot around 60 degrees which maybe normal hence the heat sink processor usually works between 45 and 95 degrees need to add ram for better performance hdd slot available but may need to change stock bracket ad it only support ssd overall good experience
liked the laptop i have a msi gaming laptop i7 16gb the performance of the laptop seems than that of msi the battery back also seems good though i havent played any games on it with music and browsing i am getting 3hrs plus the violet color keyboard doesnt feel so good but its ok

pros1 good display2 manageable temperatures3 budget friendly value for money cons1 keys are not visible even during the day without backlit on2 performance sometimes throttles for a few seconds while playing gamesconclusion great buy for the price further you can update ram and ssd as well whenever needed
all of the performance of this laptop was literally good but battery is not goodin my opinion this laptop is a beast im very happy with this laptop thankyou flipkartfor giving me this best deal
all the things are good come with beast processor allthe things are pros cons battery backup is less hinj may get loose faster as her older versions have that problemcomes with massive blotware suggetion if you need performance just buy it blindly and reinstall windows with iso from microsoft website windows license automatic it takes and blotware get removedover all loved the product
ok the laptop is good and its worth buying but look for discounts the thing by which i am not impressed is its sound and battery life it hardly gives you a 4 hr battery life on a normal use and my phones sound is more louder than its sound rest everything is perfect i loved it
honest review if you aare going for this laptop there is a one major problembuild quality of laptop is worse you can even sense when you hold the laptopyeah some peoplemwill say that is gives flexibility and anyother stuff i have been using this laptop since 9months i suggest go for acer or pay more and go for asus best build quality and gives you best look and performancedefinately go for asus
very nice product feeling very happy to work in this laptop its good laptop for both developers and gamers hi mechanical engineering guys its made for you you can do 3d modeling cad hypermesh meshing etc nicely in this laptop
actually looking for a budget gaming laptop then i got this for a budget price and the performance was awesome and display quality is very great but the only con is the low audio output needs to install special drivers or external speakers for high audibilitybattery backup is also very good with the ryzen 5 5600h hexa core processor with 144hz refresh rate absolutely good
performance was great display and sound quality is good when playing heavy games like pubg it needs it requires to connect the charges otherwise game lags and fps drop drastically some people says that the build quality was not good but i really like the overall built quality overall value for money laptop go for it if you want a top notch budget gaming laptop
it is the best experience im feeling after buying this laptop this laptop meets my expectation such a huge base frequency32ghz ram8 gb and ssd512gb all together take less than 10 sec to turn on this laptop dual fan keeps the temperature as low as possible amazing refresh rate144hz and the most important that i like much about this laptop is its graphics nvidia4 gb and amd radeon512 mbim always feels that im lucky because at this price range the laptop is more than i 
nothing extraordinary but nice product which fulfil basic requirements1 super fast boots up in 15 sec2 good build3 coding design softwares works all lag free 4 good to go in 55k bugget
i gifted this to my little brother for hes work this laptop is very fast and well built but the battery life need to improvebut over all this good option to buy specifically ryzen 5 hexa core 5600h go for it
hmm whoever is reading this most probably wants to know if they are investing in a good gaming laptop or not but rest assured this gaming laptop is the best in its price category at the time of writing this review no heating issues good performance ryzen 5 5600h speaks for itself and a good quality display not for content creation though because of low srgb talking about battery thats the weakest part of this machine if youre not gaming putting your performance to battery s
this is my first laptop i got pretty excited on the delivery day after using 2months i am writing this review everything is nice especially i like the keyboard with purple backlight display is fine battery is bad for gaming laptops if you want more battery if you are always far away from charger plug u can avoid gaming laptopsfor gaming still i need to figure it out for programming it was awesome damn sure everylikes it in this budgetfinally it is the killer in this budget
solid gaming laptop for people on a budget love the looks 100fps on most competitive games video rendering times are commendable battery life lasts for 23 hours sturdy built quality
great product i got it on 55k its really if u can get it on this price range or below in future it has a powerful cpu it heats up well while gaming but does not affect your gaming experience fans are great at maintaining temperature value for money but check carefully after delivery for any damage or missing things and yes this is a honest review
just love it definitely go for it whos budget is below 60k i got it for 53 k just 5 days before value for money gta v run ulta smoothly on realistic graphics thermals are also good mind blowing deal 75 fps in gta v is for sure
just got this beast after 5days from orderingthis is the best budget gaming laptop ever as this has the new amd processors ryzen 5 5600h just under 60k range with this gtx 1650 will perform more than you expectedchecked everything after delivery everything was good no problems and tried valorant game for gaming performance it gave 130 fps in high graphicsits the best laptop for students and also who are intrested in gaming under 65k even best under 70k budgetcons screen wobbles whi
great specs and amazing performance with 144 ghz refresh rate and for some guys still in doubt about the hinges sound or stability of hinge i dont see any issue with hinge yet the only thing that could have been better is the battery well its a gaming laptop but still could have been better but overall its great within 65k probably the best performance laptop one can get in this budget
writing this review after two days of usage pros performance is top notch if you want a laptop for performance purpose you can go for it built of laptop is decent and design is really good actually it is your preference about what design matters for you weight of the laptop is not that much heavy unlike other gaming laptops it has only 2kg weight display is also goodno issues with it cons actually it has no cons because as it is a gaming laptop these are usual for it like sli
i am using this laptop from past 14 days i was very confused between acer nitro 5 and tuf f15 and this after 2 months of deciding i finally went with this laptop and trust me guys this a very good laptop with this specs and provide value for money u will not regret to buy this laptop only con i found in this are thermals it could have been better but seriously u cant notice that difference overall i am very happy with my purchase
this laptop is best in look and performancelook wise it is very premiumbattery is not upto the mark it last only 3 hours backlit keyboard is just love boots up in 15 sec everything is good at this pricebuilt quality is very good keyboard experience is also goodi got this masterpiece at 57999 in sale you can go for it i will update the review after using it for 1 months
smooth performance great product however added extra 8gb ram and 1 tb hdd plays heavy games like gta 5 asphalt 9 very smoothly smooth browsing experience
writing this review after 2 months this laptop is absolute beast in this price segment rdr2 gta v runs smooth as butter the process is the highlight in this laptop gives desktop like performance if you want to play games use autocad lumion this laptop is for you it is the best in this price segment bought this in bigbillion day backlit keyboard is good has quite a big touchpad its has better airflow design
nice laptop using android studioand programming games all work properly so this is best laptop in budget
great product according to price all rounder laptop at this price point i bought it in sale in 55k i thought its the best time to buy and i ordered it the same day its been 6months using it experience is great i played games for long hours and done many tasks always leave space for air intake to get best performance and while gaming always plugin charger
man i love this laptop it looks so elegant the display is 144hz wled the images and videos look so crisp it is powered by amd ryzen 5600h which is on par or better with i5 10th generation chips of intel the graphics card is nvidia gtx 1650 which can handle almost all games at medium to high graphics settings the best thing about this laptop is its extremely fast boot up speed there are exhaust outlets at the bottom as well as below the screen the only negative thing that i found is
this was my first lappy and im totally satisfied with itits a good lappy for gamingalthough it gets heated quite fast while playing aaa titles if youre not a hardcore gamer then youll like it but then again i play all the aaa titles out there and havent face any problems
if u are looking for mid range gaming laptop and for other stuffs you can go with it iam writing this review after 2 days of delivery performance is awesome battery is good display is also up to the mark finally a good choice iam happy with this laptop
i had purchased the laptop in may got it for rs 54990 then it was it decently great deal the build quality is just average and the battery life is fine for decent usage rest all aspects of this laptop are great considering its price also the above mentioned cons can be ignored for the sole reason 
writing this review after 3 months absolutely value for money product and totally safe and secure delivery by flipkart absolutely happy with their service just one drawback that you cant purchase an extended warranty of 3yrs from hp website as flipkart is not their official partner bt 1yr warranty is there so no need to worry so you can blindly go for it 
an amazing budget gaming laptop can easily run most of the aaa titles performance is great a really good choice for under 60000 gaming laptops definitely worth it
i love it best performancelook is sexy battery backup is low 2 to max 3 hours overall lapy is very nice
best laptop under 55k budget for all your requirementsbattery life is not great but similar like of any gaming laptop around34 hr of continuous use go for it without a single thought
after using 15 days pros performance is good fast refresh rate good looking hp branding cons i cannot customise fans speed and fans automatically high and low even in low intensive work but its battery performance is not so good i have facing over heat issuebut overall its great laptop for high intensive work 45
good product highly recommended for gaming display was smoother than you think battery was good enough to run more than 6 hours in normal usage
a really good all rounder laptop with decent battery backup as well the only down side being the light plastic build quality but still its worth the price coz the performance we get and also considering the good battery life compared to other laptop of this segment and also the speakers are genuinely louder than most laptop
best laptop at this price range pros new ryzen processor decent graphics card 144hz display 500gb ssd cool design etc cons 3hr battery backup poor quality webcam
best in this price point i bough it in 56 k in bigbillion day battery backup is very low for simple work it can go for 4 hour max to max but for edting or gamming please use direct power on charging it get you battery well and performance is top knotch no doubt screen is very smooth 
 great design value for money best display best performance have best look and backlight purple keyboard is also awesome
if you are looking for solely gaming then go for i5 11 gen its better then ryzen 5600h in terms if gaming i have noticed sudden frame drops while playing gta v and others high end gamesframe drops are rare but yeah you will see some jitters while gamingover all the product is okayish performance is avg battery is kinda low although battery doesnt really matters much the only things really good would be its thermals i would suggest u to explore other options as there are better
fantastic machine which hits all the correct checkboxes i am using this for my development purposes and internet surfing the system is speedy however i found the battery backup is a little lower because this will work for 35hrs on the battery than you have to to look for a socket must buy recommended
ssd ram is not brandedhynix ram ssd is installed in it other wise the laptop is good if you just upgrade to good ssd and ram
very nice
awesome laptop great performance really good for editing and gaming
superb in every aspect you can play games at 1080p battery and display us awesome it has an upgaradble ram slot upto 16gb you can extend the storage by using a sata hdd or sata ssd of 25 inch one thing i want to clarify is that although in specs it is written to have wifi version 5 but it actually comes with wifi 6
so far 1 week the experience is awesome
great performanceno heating issuescrystal clear displaygreat adaptor of 150 wattno wobble issue as suchawesome keyboard lookswhat could have been better battery fan makes some soundyou can definitely go for it 
battery capacity is bit low but performance is still great though
got this under 65k in 64k its a great deal performance is good because of ssd its very snapy im a engineering student it fulfills my all needs and in gaming scenario its op because of the gpu and cpu combo at this price range ill inform my gaming performance in details after some more testing and one thing use this laptop for gaming on charging timeit gives more fps
awesome product display quality is really nice it performs as per specs it should be marked as best laptop under 70k no other option in this price tag comes near to this beast a bug thumps up to hp recommended
there exists no competition for this product hp has introduced such a good laptop at such an unexpected price that the complains just diminish by seeing this laptops supremacy 
performance45battery4display42design4build quality37in this price range there is no other laptop who can compete with this 
overall better than others brand s 
value for money
loved it storage feels too low but is upgradeble temperature do not hit above 83 c while playing rdr2 it can give you 30 40 fps at ultra settings in rdr2 
by first impression its fast i will update review after 1 week usethank you flipkart for such a instant delivery
great laptop in this price range
we are satisfied with the product value for money no heating problem battery performance was good delivery was very late
awesome laptop for its price performance is as expected form the processor and gpu no overheating issues if you dont block the vents and keep the laptop cleanhigher refresh rate screens are a gem to use although display quality can be improvedthe only thing that bothers me is having two usb ports instead of threei usually keep mouse and keyboard plugged in and if i want to use a pendrive i have to remove one thing although a usb hub fixes this problem but an extra port wouldve been 
just go for it 
not bad not bad
just osm you get more than u pay 
anyone who is concerned with battery life please update your system even update the additional optional updatesi used to have 12 hrs of battery life and then i updated it now it usually gives me around 45 hrs doing coding and watching youtubeoverall its a nice package screen is smooth but only concern with brightness and also keyboards keys are not visible correctly
so far so good its really value for money i will update my review after some time
great laptop in budget segment
nice product
great product in this price range
overall good device there are minor issues here and their like the battery it is a gaming device so cant complain but still it needs to be charged like every 4 hours or so build quality is good youll feel the smoothness when you use it
excellent product
really wonder this laptop amazing performance and thermal control with two cooling fans i faced draining battery very quick with 1 he later i updated bios so it now giving 3 to 4 hrs backup in 100 charging also faced issue with warrenty it was started already three months before from i purchased date so i reached hp care and they updated with correct date
bought it for 44k with flipkart axis card in the sale and i can say it is worth every penny the only con i felt is that there is no fan control and battery charging limit like other brands and somewhat less battery life but anyways it is the best laptop if you can buy it under 50k
no one is telling about the built qualitybuilt quality is very poorscrunch sound is coming while lifting the laptopbut performance of the laptop is good and display is also okay
best laptop in this price range getting 200 on valorant and 100fps on gta5
its super cool laptop for such a priceshould consider to buybut you can check for other alsolike asus tuf easy to use laptopi have compared asus tuf and thisfor me this stands
ive upgraded myself from using a pentium pc to a ryzen 5 5600h you can already guess how happy i am such a beast 
it is wonderful laptop i have been using this for 9 months it is very fast i also added additional 8gb ram as you know windows 11 itself took 4gb ramthe display color is kind of slight yellowish we can change that by adjusting color optimizationgaming is so awesome i was sceptical about tv cut display before purchasing but it turned out so well i like it very much
terrific purchaseplayed gta v valorant both give on max settings 70 170 to 200 fps respectivelyoverall good as of now
great laptop at this price range dont think just go for it 
one of the best in market according to its price
really good laptop for its price performance 1010 i recommend upgrading to 16 gb ram battery more than 45 hrs on normal usage might feel a bit heavy to carry though and the screen wobbles a bit but that wont be a big issue totally recommended 
the laptop is awesome smooth browsing and no lags havent tested the gaming yet but there is instant power dissipation but when you switch to 60 hz from 144 hz the power consumption gets reduced and it gives the battery backup of around 3 hrs on normal usage otherwise if you continue in 144 hz power consumption is more thats the only cons in it the rest is awesome the display processor graphics and all
good product 
got it for 58k and it was best in terms of specs in the range
its the best laptop you can find at this price point the performance is great and can give a battery life of around 3hrs when not in charging
ryzen 5 and 1650 coupled with a 144 hz display makes for the best budget gaming setupi mostly only play csgo so here are some benchmarks for the same1280x960 everything on low except anti aliasing which ks set at 8x gives 200270 fps easily with it touching 300 in some areas of the map1440x1080 almost the samegta 5 gives around 7080 fps on ultra settingscomes with windows 10 but after a few updates you get the option to upgrade to windows 11 for freeoverall a deadly 
really worth buying
just amazing killer performance loved it best for development as of my use 
terrific purchase 100 perfect quality no issues best laptop ever in the segment with the most recent 5600h processor which performs each and every task seamlessly even the updates too better when compared to asus rog msi dell of same segmentboot time just 45 secondsexcellent choice for multitasking150w power adaptor no heating issues included in boxwifi 6 has additional ssd and ram 8 gb slot
battery backup is ok but performance is superbsounds is also good screen refresh rate is awesome youll love gaming e sports in it

wifi 6 is terrible shows 2 strength signal at 2metre distance from the wifi uses realtek wifi card which is very controversial for gamingframe dropsping spikeshigh ping checked with other laptop have intel ax200 wifi card gives me 4 ms ping without any spike hp pavilion gives 30 40 50 ms and frequent spikes of 100 120 so research about the network connectivity before you buy best choice for the price range and performance that beats i7 11th gen and the 144herts display is just amaz

overall i buy this laptop to run design software like catia and autoform but its performance is not up to mark
i got it at very low price
got on bbd at an awesome deal of nobody here has posted till now loved it the only drawback is that the battery drains too fast overall its a nice choice 
got windows 11 installed june 2022 datedbrightness 300 nits and wifi 6 just go for it in this price it can beat i5 i7 10 th gen star performer first i recieved power button issue but flipkart replaced it for a brand new laptop and have to wait a little bit more because it takes almost 2 month to be replaced but finally got itno concern now at all
delivery sucked but the products is really worth the price
excellent
this laptop is beast in all aspects battery backup is 2 hrs on normal use value for money
i have been using this since 8 months the design is awesome and it shows no problem till now laptop is very good for the person who works on graphics related thingsdesigning people must consider this
this is very good laptop according to mebest in gaming and codingdesign is next level value for 
overall a good laptopthere are some issues thoughthe display is set by default by windows 11 to 125 some windows especially settings windows legacy ones appear a little blurry at 100 the text is too small so at 120 the text appeared less blurry but mcafee could not scale down to this custom scale factorthe keypad is a little different for a click a tap works fine on the keypad but the force required for a deliberate click like on a macbook keypad is comparatively much lesse
good product improve in fast delivery
cons1 body is finger print magnet gets stained easily2 battery life is lesspros1 got it for 58k2 overall serves its purpose it hanged when i first used it such that i had ro turn it off from power button no escape sequence workeddidnt like gaming but i installed csgo to test the performance it is ok
overall nice but built quality could be downfall
cant control fan speed heating too much performance good
battery draining fastits my piece or all like that
overall a good product performancesound and display are pretty good the only problem is the build quality
delivered the product on scheduled time within this price range and configuration wise perfect choice
thank you flipkart for this awesome product
i got this for 60k and its just awesome i loved the performance but since its a gaming laptop battery backup is not that much satisfying still its a good product and value for money
awesome hardware i added 8 gb ram with 1 tb hdd and made it a beast 
best laptop under 60000 i loved it
fab just buy additional 8gb ram 3200 mhz to make it even more amazing there is one free slot for ram up to 16gb ram it supports

prosgood product battery life is fine too especially considering that its a gaming laptop blazing fast performance great display and sound qualitynote comes with a 30 day trial of ms office and mcafee antivirus cons the display is not too sturdy theres creaking noise at times and shakes when the fan speed is high
it fulfils all your need much better than i5 11gen
played valorant so far got over continues 190 fps on high settings
sexy
one of the best laptop for gaming have been playing some high graphics games and the performance is very smooth you can do multi tasking at ease the only drawback is the battery while gaming you get battery for 3 hours and without gaming it goes higher upto 6 hours rest assured this is a beast and worth the value
laptop is a great deal in the price range worked with premiere pro and adobe photoshop both render and run super smoothly3 month free trail is included for this product this display is greatthe dolby audio is fantastic and the body is metallic finish i dont play games so cant say about itthe battery backup is over 4 to 6 hours in normal use overall a terrific purchase i love it got a wings
i have a soft corner for dell but nowadays dell laptops are too costly to bear after my first time buying an asus laptop i can only say ahh an amazing one its a lightweight creator as well as a gaming laptop the amd ryzen 7 4800h processor is really good it takes 1 15 sec to open from shutdown position the battery backup is quite decent 9 10 hours and the display is just awesomethough it has a plastic body it is a sturdy one not the cheap type and the overall loo

writing this review after using it for almost a month bought it in big billion days for 28k everything is fine with this laptop except its battery but that will not be a problem if you are not a heavy user just keep it plugged in this laptop is perfect for basic uses like browsing and coding do not buy it if you want to do photo and video editing
best in budget not expect more than enough this is enough 8 gb ram 512 gb ssd is giving nice performance 
writing this review after 3 days use first of all i will say just go for it its a lovely laptop without any problemeveryone is saying about battery backup that battery backup is not good but thats not true battery backup of this laptop is 56 hours in normal use of continuously display is awesome design is amazing performance is best i think i have cleared all doubts of all of who are seeing reviews free advice dont think too much bro or sis just 
this is only for offline office work person performance is very good in this price bracket important note only one thing i dont like about this laptop is 45ntsc display i think its manage that because of lower price those who wants for multimedia dont go for it go for the oled screen varient 
best in quality designexcellent quality displaybest in quality keyboard and touchpadquick and nice fingerprint sensorbattery life is fine lasts almost 3 hours on full charge speakers are of average quality ram can be upgraded upto 16 gb but it has only 1 upgradeable memory slot as one slot is already being fixed with the motherboard overall must buy laptop if youre looking to buy something around 30k

definitely the best if your budget is under 55k i got it for 52k during the big billion day sale i thought of going for hp pavilion with ryzen 5 5600 which is better processor compared to ryzen 5 4600 but the hp pavilion design and keyboard colour looks dull and unattractive i am very satisfied with this laptop everything is fine till now i have been using it for 5 days i will provide the full review after a couple of months battery is good considering a gaming laptop gives me ar
one of the best laptop for under 60kperformance is excellent i dont find any lag during multi tasking or gaming battery back up is very good it could give a battery life of around 3hrs while gaming and around 5 to 6 hours for browsing rgb was turned off and display brightness was around 20 mostly display is very good but not very colour accurate so if youre buying this for editing purposes i wont recommend this because of the colour accuracy issuebuilding quality and

a very good laptop overall for regular use the design and build quality are top notch as always asus has made an excellent machine keeping users in mind the laptop reminds of the old days when laptops used to be bulky and included led indicators for things like power and caps lock the multiple indicators are really helpful especially the red indicators on power button and caps lock look cool the power button shape also gives it a great look the keyboard is as close to a classic keybo
the laptop is pretty amazing in the price range i have played far cry 3 and witcher 3 on it and it processed both of them very smoothly the graphics are also amazingthe things i liked the most are the screen size and the refresh rate both of them makes you love to work on it the keys are also smooth the 90whr battery performs as promised although one major drawback i faced was that sometimes there comes a lag between the audio and video when connected to a bluetooth headset nor

every this is blazing fast but tn display is not worth it n speakers are average better to go with asus series where you get good package overall

lenovo ideapad slim 3 is good but the only thing is display quality is not so good but also not bad because if you visit alot of white color web pages or white products or you have to work with white screens then this laptop with this display quality is not suitable but over all performance is awesome and processor speed is also very good and the design of laptop is premium look and sound quality is also good there is no complaints with the speed and performance and processor overall a

this laptop is the prime example of value for money earlier i was considering to buy acer nitro 5 i5 11th gen and then i saw some reviews and youtube and found out that this ryzen processor is newer and performs better in multi tasking and battery backup is better than the intel counterpart the laptop is very beautiful especially the ultra violet back lit keyboard and the design of this laptop is just so pretty i was lucky enough to cop this laptop even when this was out of stock
incredible buyhave been using it for past 5 daysflipkarts delivery was incredibly fast and appeared before due date in perfect conditioni havent tested gaming though but on a day to day task this machine is a beastyou can through anything at it it will play it with easemy work has been mostly for office usebattery backup is adequate for melooks stunningdont bother to look for any laptop at this price range just go for itwill update the gaming review shortly
overall laptop was so so awesome only the problem is it has less ports compare to other laptops charging also very fast battery backup was good enough as per your use design quality performance 100 fabulous must buy highly recommended you can buy this laptop and additional you can also purchase 1tb or 2tb hdd then alltogether it works faster compare to other models this laptop will worth it with all features
got it today the packaging was great and everything on the outside looks fine the laptop works as smooth as butter just go for it if you need a good laptop with high processing power worth the money will update my review after a weeks usage
the product was really good and best for gamingamd ryzen 5 5600h the processor is beast with 4gb nvidia geforce gtx display with 144hz is awesome156 inches but battery backup is average it should be improved other than that this laptop is best for 60k budget regarding delivery it was delivered within 24 hours really good iam satisfied and this laptop is value for money go for it
i didnt expect wow this is very good laptop and performance is nice and display also good but battery is average but its backup around 56 hrs easily in low brightness in normal uses and gaming aroun 335 but good overall you can buy this laptop its good i will give 5 stars 
in that price range its awesome ssd speed is very fast than imaginelap design is also goodscreen 144hz is nice and quality of screen is very goodbut battery need to improve
excellent delivery great display and refresh rategpu performance not up to the mark but still does the jobexcellent cpu performance and balanced thermalsperfectly runs games like control rdr2 gta online and so on
everything is good if you can grab one hp victus at same price that is more awesomebattery is pretty average but not that badplease note these thingsthere is no ms office with laptop you have pay extra for that type c is just for data transfer no charging support no finger print scanner
lapi is good performance is bestfrom last 7 days i am using it good performance and battery is goodthose who want to play game or use cad software it can be good choice 
this laptop is amazing and no one is comparable to this one in this price range if you want a laptop for gaming editing coding just go for it itll do all the work just as good so far i played valorant 144fps and fornite with 100fps around just got it 2 days back to getting used but will tell as i play more but this one is a beast in its price and offers everything one would need
best product under 65k budget go for itit will not disappoint youbelieve in pavilion the only concern is batterybut that is understandable that it is gaming laptop you cant expect much about battery backlit is just wow bcoz before purchasing i was not sure about how purple backlit would look but after seeing physically it really impressed me 
as a normal user sharing the pros and cons herepros fast bootup it turns on in 10sec and turn off in 4 sec display quality is awesome runs too smoothly beautifully designed with purple backlitbacklit looks great but for the person uses backlit daily can go for white backlit purple is viberant no heating at allcons should have given ms office heavy weight wise plastic on the top of lid is softloose which feels laptop delicate from topi used plastic lamination
great laptop at this price range for studentsim not a gamer if you are a student you can also buy it for android studio or editing videos because it has dedicated gpu pros 1 comes with nvidia gtx16502 144 hz refresh rate3 amd ryzen 5600h better than core i5 12th gen4 display is very good in this segment 5 clean look and also comes under 2 kg of weight which is just insane for gaming laptop others are like 23 25 or 22 kg cons only con is low battery backup lik
writing this review after 3 months of usage1 the performance is ferocious and heavy af the ryzen 5600h is just beast 2 geforce gtx 1650 is very powerful and enough if you are a gaming freak or some 4k editing3 the 144hz refresh rate is just lit4 battery is descent it usually gives me 34 hrs on normal usage5 overall value for money product if your budget allows you then go for this and please dont go with asus tufthe only con is it catches finger prints as it is matt finishe

after one week of usage it feels like a quality laptop at this price range of 60k gaming performance is good good for multi tasking windows 11 readily available when you initially setup your new laptop battery capacity is average like all other laptops
very nice laptop and value for money it has wifi 6 this is the the best in this price range got it for 59k thanks flipkart for good service and good quality experiencethe delivery was also on time and got a proper open box deliverythank youedit after 20days of use its working fine as thought and got the window 11 update too but a con is that its matt finish attracts dust and finger marks the new feeling of the laptop goes away in one day and you just cant keep it cle
it meets all my requirements playing valorant and fortnight is fun on this beast the 144hz screen is super smooth and responsive but only problem is with the matt finish it attracts lot of fingerprints and smudges overall at the price its worth it

the laptop is fabulous highly recommendedmy personal opinion1 the performance is awesome would be more better with 16 gb ram but i dont have any problem because the ram is upgradable 2 the battery backup is not good enough for multimedia and movie watchers since it is a gaming laptop so you may not expect more than 5 hours on movies and multimedia but i think since it is a gaming laptop the battery backup is good enoughsince anybody is not gonna play games on the battery3t
100 satisfaction value for money productperformance of laptop is way better than other competitors at this price battery is little bit its minus point but it is a gaming laptop so its considerable it charges rapidly thanks to its 150w adaptor display is crisp clear display size156 144hz you can consider this gaming laptop in this price overall best gaming laptopprocessor ryzen 5 5600h amd radeon 550m integrated graphic card and geforce nvidia gtx 1650 dedicated graphic card
the overall performance of this laptop is goodi checked offline prices of the same laptop which is around 74kthus i bought laptop at 60k online im quite happy with the pricing and this is only laptop available of 5600h series at this price range the only cons is hp should have improved its build quality
best in this priceryzen 5 5600h 144hz screen what else do you needonly con is the battery back up is not much because the processor powerful and screen is 144 hzbut its a gaming laptop so plug in and play absolute beastgames that i tested valorant 200 fps genshin impact 60 fps stablepubg pc 60 fps
laptop is good under 60k is good but screen quality and speaker quality not up to mark there is no base in voice i suggest you to go for lenovo because of camera shutter and good speaker i choose this bcoz of budget and hdd slot msi bravo 15 is amazing but absence of hdd slot thats why i choose this 
this laptop has excellent performance and i used laptop for this 4 months one issue i had found that keyboard r key is not working when i buy this laptop but their hp service is very good day before yesterday they came to our house and change the new keyboard panel and its working fine our home also in a village but they come and fix that issue thank you hponly battery backup comes for 3 to 4 hrs but other than that its very in this offer price
awesome productthe main pros of this product is display crisp and clear look like an olednext thing is very smooth in this price compare with othersthis is beast
i have been using this laptop for last 1 months with external keyboard and mouse and i caught some issues which are 1 something the usb post dont work so i need to interchange the keyboard cable to other usb port and mouse to that usb port2 somethimes the wifi dont know work at all so i need to reboot the laptop this used to happen with my previous laptop also this wifi problemwait for next review
writing this review after 1 week of usageeverything is just awesome good for daily work and gaming no complaints comes with windows 11 home out of the box but doesnt have windows office which is the only fault else it lit and another thing which is lit is the backlit keypad just love it
got it for 54k worth the money processor heating issues not observed but the m2 ssd area gets hot around 60 degrees which maybe normal hence the heat sink processor usually works between 45 and 95 degrees need to add ram for better performance hdd slot available but may need to change stock bracket ad it only support ssd overall good experience
liked the laptop i have a msi gaming laptop i7 16gb the performance of the laptop seems than that of msi the battery back also seems good though i havent played any games on it with music and browsing i am getting 3hrs plus the violet color keyboard doesnt feel so good but its ok

its great at this price range loved this laptop performance is really great and i also loved this design 
best budget gaming laptop impressed with the overall performance of this laptop have been using it over two weeks or so and it performs really well the ryzen processor runs cooler than the intel variant can upgrade this to 16gb with the additional ram slot make sure to opt for open box delivery and check the authenticity of the productprosdisplay is brilliantbattery is pretty goodno lag issues faced with most games soft touch keyboardlooks fantasticconsaudio intensity is a b
beast performance good audio quality display is also good only battery last for 3 hr so use on adapter while doing heavy tasks thermals are good it dont heat too muchdo no wobble i bought it rather than victus because victus wobble a lotbought it for58490 decent budget but if have no issue with wobble go for victus it has good battery life thermal are also good
it is best gaming laptop things i love in this laptop is its thermal and 144 hz refresh rate display and amd ryzen 5 5600h with gtx 1650
best laptop in this price range i got it at around 54k in big billion days i am a very light user and i have never played any game nor will i try but may be i can try a few cricket games in future display display is good but brightness could have been more 144 hz is very smooth battery i have used it around 2 hours for internet surfing and watching videos and battery decreased from about 55 to 25 percent so thirty percent for two hours seems good maybe gaming will consume m
pros display quality is excellent 55audio quality 55we update to windows 11 1 month mso validitykeyboard quality is good 55less boot time less than 7 secondsconsbattery 45 hr0 brightness medium brightness 23 hr nothing more i loved it a lot its a beast 
ryzen 5 5600h is a beast6c 12t best for editing programming and gaming as well nice thermals good build quality though fingerprint marks annoys me sometimes graphics card gtx 1650 is good for decent gaming and can run almost every new generation games in medium settings 40 fps
pros1 good display2 manageable temperatures3 budget friendly value for money cons1 keys are not visible even during the day without backlit on2 performance sometimes throttles for a few seconds while playing gamesconclusion great buy for the price further you can update ram and ssd as well whenever needed
all of the performance of this laptop was literally good but battery is not goodin my opinion this laptop is a beast im very happy with this laptop thankyou flipkartfor giving me this best deal
i am using this laptop from past 14 days i was very confused between acer nitro 5 and tuf f15 and this after 2 months of deciding i finally went with this laptop and trust me guys this a very good laptop with this specs and provide value for money u will not regret to buy this laptop only con i found in this are thermals it could have been better but seriously u cant notice that difference overall i am very happy with my purchase
all the things are good come with beast processor allthe things are pros cons battery backup is less hinj may get loose faster as her older versions have that problemcomes with massive blotware suggetion if you need performance just buy it blindly and reinstall windows with iso from microsoft website windows license automatic it takes and blotware get removedover all loved the product
ok the laptop is good and its worth buying but look for discounts the thing by which i am not impressed is its sound and battery life it hardly gives you a 4 hr battery life on a normal use and my phones sound is more louder than its sound rest everything is perfect i loved it
honest review if you aare going for this laptop there is a one major problembuild quality of laptop is worse you can even sense when you hold the laptopyeah some peoplemwill say that is gives flexibility and anyother stuff i have been using this laptop since 9months i suggest go for acer or pay more and go for asus best build quality and gives you best look and performancedefinately go for asus
very nice product feeling very happy to work in this laptop its good laptop for both developers and gamers hi mechanical engineering guys its made for you you can do 3d modeling cad hypermesh meshing etc nicely in this laptop
actually looking for a budget gaming laptop then i got this for a budget price and the performance was awesome and display quality is very great but the only con is the low audio output needs to install special drivers or external speakers for high audibilitybattery backup is also very good with the ryzen 5 5600h hexa core processor with 144hz refresh rate absolutely good
performance was great display and sound quality is good when playing heavy games like pubg it needs it requires to connect the charges otherwise game lags and fps drop drastically some people says that the build quality was not good but i really like the overall built quality overall value for money laptop go for it if you want a top notch budget gaming laptop
it is the best experience im feeling after buying this laptop this laptop meets my expectation such a huge base frequency32ghz ram8 gb and ssd512gb all together take less than 10 sec to turn on this laptop dual fan keeps the temperature as low as possible amazing refresh rate144hz and the most important that i like much about this laptop is its graphics nvidia4 gb and amd radeon512 mbim always feels that im lucky because at this price range the laptop is more than i 
nothing extraordinary but nice product which fulfil basic requirements1 super fast boots up in 15 sec2 good build3 coding design softwares works all lag free 4 good to go in 55k bugget
i gifted this to my little brother for hes work this laptop is very fast and well built but the battery life need to improvebut over all this good option to buy specifically ryzen 5 hexa core 5600h go for it
hmm whoever is reading this most probably wants to know if they are investing in a good gaming laptop or not but rest assured this gaming laptop is the best in its price category at the time of writing this review no heating issues good performance ryzen 5 5600h speaks for itself and a good quality display not for content creation though because of low srgb talking about battery thats the weakest part of this machine if youre not gaming putting your performance to battery s
this is my first laptop i got pretty excited on the delivery day after using 2months i am writing this review everything is nice especially i like the keyboard with purple backlight display is fine battery is bad for gaming laptops if you want more battery if you are always far away from charger plug u can avoid gaming laptopsfor gaming still i need to figure it out for programming it was awesome damn sure everylikes it in this budgetfinally it is the killer in this budget
solid gaming laptop for people on a budget love the looks 100fps on most competitive games video rendering times are commendable battery life lasts for 23 hours sturdy built quality
great product i got it on 55k its really if u can get it on this price range or below in future it has a powerful cpu it heats up well while gaming but does not affect your gaming experience fans are great at maintaining temperature value for money but check carefully after delivery for any damage or missing things and yes this is a honest review
just love it definitely go for it whos budget is below 60k i got it for 53 k just 5 days before value for money gta v run ulta smoothly on realistic graphics thermals are also good mind blowing deal 75 fps in gta v is for sure

great specs and amazing performance with 144 ghz refresh rate and for some guys still in doubt about the hinges sound or stability of hinge i dont see any issue with hinge yet the only thing that could have been better is the battery well its a gaming laptop but still could have been better but overall its great within 65k probably the best performance laptop one can get in this budget
writing this review after two days of usage pros performance is top notch if you want a laptop for performance purpose you can go for it built of laptop is decent and design is really good actually it is your preference about what design matters for you weight of the laptop is not that much heavy unlike other gaming laptops it has only 2kg weight display is also goodno issues with it cons actually it has no cons because as it is a gaming laptop these are usual for it like sli
this laptop is best in look and performancelook wise it is very premiumbattery is not upto the mark it last only 3 hours backlit keyboard is just love boots up in 15 sec everything is good at this pricebuilt quality is very good keyboard experience is also goodi got this masterpiece at 57999 in sale you can go for it i will update the review after using it for 1 months
smooth performance great product however added extra 8gb ram and 1 tb hdd plays heavy games like gta 5 asphalt 9 very smoothly smooth browsing experience
writing this review after 2 months this laptop is absolute beast in this price segment rdr2 gta v runs smooth as butter the process is the highlight in this laptop gives desktop like performance if you want to play games use autocad lumion this laptop is for you it is the best in this price segment bought this in bigbillion day backlit keyboard is good has quite a big touchpad its has better airflow design
nice laptop using android studioand programming games all work properly so this is best laptop in budget
great product according to price all rounder laptop at this price point i bought it in sale in 55k i thought its the best time to buy and i ordered it the same day its been 6months using it experience is great i played games for long hours and done many tasks always leave space for air intake to get best performance and while gaming always plugin charger
man i love this laptop it looks so elegant the display is 144hz wled the images and videos look so crisp it is powered by amd ryzen 5600h which is on par or better with i5 10th generation chips of intel the graphics card is nvidia gtx 1650 which can handle almost all games at medium to high graphics settings the best thing about this laptop is its extremely fast boot up speed there are exhaust outlets at the bottom as well as below the screen the only negative thing that i found is
this was my first lappy and im totally satisfied with itits a good lappy for gamingalthough it gets heated quite fast while playing aaa titles if youre not a hardcore gamer then youll like it but then again i play all the aaa titles out there and havent face any problems
if u are looking for mid range gaming laptop and for other stuffs you can go with it iam writing this review after 2 days of delivery performance is awesome battery is good display is also up to the mark finally a good choice iam happy with this laptop
i had purchased the laptop in may got it for rs 54990 then it was it decently great deal the build quality is just average and the battery life is fine for decent usage rest all aspects of this laptop are great considering its price also the above mentioned cons can be ignored for the sole reason 
writing this review after 3 months absolutely value for money product and totally safe and secure delivery by flipkart absolutely happy with their service just one drawback that you cant purchase an extended warranty of 3yrs from hp website as flipkart is not their official partner bt 1yr warranty is there so no need to worry so you can blindly go for it 
an amazing budget gaming laptop can easily run most of the aaa titles performance is great a really good choice for under 60000 gaming laptops definitely worth it
i love it best performancelook is sexy battery backup is low 2 to max 3 hours overall lapy is very nice
best laptop under 55k budget for all your requirementsbattery life is not great but similar like of any gaming laptop around34 hr of continuous use go for it without a single thought
after using 15 days pros performance is good fast refresh rate good looking hp branding cons i cannot customise fans speed and fans automatically high and low even in low intensive work but its battery performance is not so good i have facing over heat issuebut overall its great laptop for high intensive work 45
good product highly recommended for gaming display was smoother than you think battery was good enough to run more than 6 hours in normal usage
a really good all rounder laptop with decent battery backup as well the only down side being the light plastic build quality but still its worth the price coz the performance we get and also considering the good battery life compared to other laptop of this segment and also the speakers are genuinely louder than most laptop
best laptop at this price range pros new ryzen processor decent graphics card 144hz display 500gb ssd cool design etc cons 3hr battery backup poor quality webcam
best in this price point i bough it in 56 k in bigbillion day battery backup is very low for simple work it can go for 4 hour max to max but for edting or gamming please use direct power on charging it get you battery well and performance is top knotch no doubt screen is very smooth 
 great design value for money best display best performance have best look and backlight purple keyboard is also awesome
if you are looking for solely gaming then go for i5 11 gen its better then ryzen 5600h in terms if gaming i have noticed sudden frame drops while playing gta v and others high end gamesframe drops are rare but yeah you will see some jitters while gamingover all the product is okayish performance is avg battery is kinda low although battery doesnt really matters much the only things really good would be its thermals i would suggest u to explore other options as there are better
fantastic machine which hits all the correct checkboxes i am using this for my development purposes and internet surfing the system is speedy however i found the battery backup is a little lower because this will work for 35hrs on the battery than you have to to look for a socket must buy recommended
ssd ram is not brandedhynix ram ssd is installed in it other wise the laptop is good if you just upgrade to good ssd and ram
very nice
awesome laptop great performance really good for editing and gaming
superb in every aspect you can play games at 1080p battery and display us awesome it has an upgaradble ram slot upto 16gb you can extend the storage by using a sata hdd or sata ssd of 25 inch one thing i want to clarify is that although in specs it is written to have wifi version 5 but it actually comes with wifi 6
so far 1 week the experience is awesome
great performanceno heating issuescrystal clear displaygreat adaptor of 150 wattno wobble issue as suchawesome keyboard lookswhat could have been better battery fan makes some soundyou can definitely go for it 
battery capacity is bit low but performance is still great though
got this under 65k in 64k its a great deal performance is good because of ssd its very snapy im a engineering student it fulfills my all needs and in gaming scenario its op because of the gpu and cpu combo at this price range ill inform my gaming performance in details after some more testing and one thing use this laptop for gaming on charging timeit gives more fps
awesome product display quality is really nice it performs as per specs it should be marked as best laptop under 70k no other option in this price tag comes near to this beast a bug thumps up to hp recommended
overall better than others brand s 
value for money
loved it storage feels too low but is upgradeble temperature do not hit above 83 c while playing rdr2 it can give you 30 40 fps at ultra settings in rdr2 
by first impression its fast i will update review after 1 week usethank you flipkart for such a instant delivery
great laptop in this price range
we are satisfied with the product value for money no heating problem battery performance was good delivery was very late
awesome laptop for its price performance is as expected form the processor and gpu no overheating issues if you dont block the vents and keep the laptop cleanhigher refresh rate screens are a gem to use although display quality can be improvedthe only thing that bothers me is having two usb ports instead of threei usually keep mouse and keyboard plugged in and if i want to use a pendrive i have to remove one thing although a usb hub fixes this problem but an extra port wouldve been 
just go for it 
its a pioneer in every aspect and task apart from battery battery lasts for 2 hours to 25 at moderate use go for it if battery aint a concern
not bad not bad
just osm you get more than u pay 
anyone who is concerned with battery life please update your system even update the additional optional updatesi used to have 12 hrs of battery life and then i updated it now it usually gives me around 45 hrs doing coding and watching youtubeoverall its a nice package screen is smooth but only concern with brightness and also keyboards keys are not visible correctly
so far so good its really value for money i will update my review after some time
great laptop in budget segment
nice product
great product in this price range
overall good device there are minor issues here and their like the battery it is a gaming device so cant complain but still it needs to be charged like every 4 hours or so build quality is good youll feel the smoothness when you use it
excellent product
really wonder this laptop amazing performance and thermal control with two cooling fans i faced draining battery very quick with 1 he later i updated bios so it now giving 3 to 4 hrs backup in 100 charging also faced issue with warrenty it was started already three months before from i purchased date so i reached hp care and they updated with correct date
bought it for 44k with flipkart axis card in the sale and i can say it is worth every penny the only con i felt is that there is no fan control and battery charging limit like other brands and somewhat less battery life but anyways it is the best laptop if you can buy it under 50k
no one is telling about the built qualitybuilt quality is very poorscrunch sound is coming while lifting the laptopbut performance of the laptop is good and display is also okay
best laptop in this price range getting 200 on valorant and 100fps on gta5
its super cool laptop for such a priceshould consider to buybut you can check for other alsolike asus tuf easy to use laptopi have compared asus tuf and thisfor me this stands
ultimate
ive upgraded myself from using a pentium pc to a ryzen 5 5600h you can already guess how happy i am such a beast 
it is wonderful laptop i have been using this for 9 months it is very fast i also added additional 8gb ram as you know windows 11 itself took 4gb ramthe display color is kind of slight yellowish we can change that by adjusting color optimizationgaming is so awesome i was sceptical about tv cut display before purchasing but it turned out so well i like it very much
terrific purchaseplayed gta v valorant both give on max settings 70 170 to 200 fps respectivelyoverall good as of now
great laptop at this price range dont think just go for it 
one of the best in market according to its price
really good laptop for its price performance 1010 i recommend upgrading to 16 gb ram battery more than 45 hrs on normal usage might feel a bit heavy to carry though and the screen wobbles a bit but that wont be a big issue totally recommended 
the laptop is awesome smooth browsing and no lags havent tested the gaming yet but there is instant power dissipation but when you switch to 60 hz from 144 hz the power consumption gets reduced and it gives the battery backup of around 3 hrs on normal usage otherwise if you continue in 144 hz power consumption is more thats the only cons in it the rest is awesome the display processor graphics and all
good product 
got it for 58k and it was best in terms of specs in the range
its the best laptop you can find at this price point the performance is great and can give a battery life of around 3hrs when not in charging
ryzen 5 and 1650 coupled with a 144 hz display makes for the best budget gaming setupi mostly only play csgo so here are some benchmarks for the same1280x960 everything on low except anti aliasing which ks set at 8x gives 200270 fps easily with it touching 300 in some areas of the map1440x1080 almost the samegta 5 gives around 7080 fps on ultra settingscomes with windows 10 but after a few updates you get the option to upgrade to windows 11 for freeoverall a deadly 
really worth buying
just amazing killer performance loved it best for development as of my use 
terrific purchase 100 perfect quality no issues best laptop ever in the segment with the most recent 5600h processor which performs each and every task seamlessly even the updates too better when compared to asus rog msi dell of same segmentboot time just 45 secondsexcellent choice for multitasking150w power adaptor no heating issues included in boxwifi 6 has additional ssd and ram 8 gb slot

wifi 6 is terrible shows 2 strength signal at 2metre distance from the wifi uses realtek wifi card which is very controversial for gamingframe dropsping spikeshigh ping checked with other laptop have intel ax200 wifi card gives me 4 ms ping without any spike hp pavilion gives 30 40 50 ms and frequent spikes of 100 120 so research about the network connectivity before you buy best choice for the price range and performance that beats i7 11th gen and the 144herts display is just amaz

overall a good laptopthere are some issues thoughthe display is set by default by windows 11 to 125 some windows especially settings windows legacy ones appear a little blurry at 100 the text is too small so at 120 the text appeared less blurry but mcafee could not scale down to this custom scale factorthe keypad is a little different for a click a tap works fine on the keypad but the force required for a deliberate click like on a macbook keypad is comparatively much lesse
good product improve in fast delivery

the only problem with my device is that one key doesnt have backlightit is a good device but the on board storage is rather lowbut the good thing is that its expandableoverall a good purchase
the best processor you can get in this price range i think the minimum brightness should be a bit lower temperature management is fine keyboard letters are hard to see without backlight
best lap under given price
worth every penny
very good thanks flipcart
build quality is very poor on right hand side of the screen there is a noticeable gap between plastic frame and screen it feels like there is a black line on the screen
super
everything thing is ok but display can crack easly very bad build quality please carefully open it flexible display panal
i was purchased this laptop 2 days back only but getting highspeed fan sound on the display side continuously fan sounddont buy at any cost pleaseafter visiting the technician also issue is same so please dont by at any cost
battery is average and display is also average but performance is good and laptop body also average overall is a average laptop
display has failed in just 19 days never expected such bad quality quality and durability is very important for any product and this is just really bad
got screen bleeding within a month display should have been better
it is all right but some time it get hang basicaly i use it for coding not gaming but still it hang and it doesnt comes with ms office
not as expected
just few days and start hanging
the screen has a gap between the frame and the display tried getting a replacement even the replacement had gap looks like the manufacturing itself is like that when checked with technician they said that it would lead to problem in the long run due to dust accumulation
very noise
laptop has screen blinking issue
monitor screen frame is so delicate and gap between frame and screenno supporting os and driver software provided as back upno free antivirus
screen is becoming blank for 2 seconds for every 10 or 15 minsseems a software bug need to work with acer or thisvery good configuration laptop but screen blank issue seems a known issue need to work on it with customer care
just few days and start hanging
have an issue with the product
only problem is that it s body is catching scratches very easily which makes the new laptop look old
the battery will last only 15 hours 
battery backup is low peformence is ok cant say value for money but its ok
very cheap quality
expect battery everything was incrediblebattery be like i can only give backup for 130 hours with battery saving mode
not bad does the job for money
battery backup issue
everything is good in laptop but one bad part is whenever u give little vibration or shake the whole display start moving installation work is super fast display clearity is superb quite heavy but awesome
battery issue only even though u use it in low configuration still battery lasts for 15 hrsif u can compromise with battery then it will be best in this range
ok but
battery backup was soo soo sooo worst and its draining very fast this laptop always use with plugin socket and sometimes i feel whether i purchased laptop or desktop display also having very low brightness performance was average overall it is a not bad and not good product i think realme laptops are more better than this laptop

everything thing is good except sound quality and loudness is very low

budget gaming laptop
overall laptop is very goodbut some cons are like its sound is low and display color accuracy is not uptomark at this price range otherwise performance is excellentedit after 15 days touchpad stop working
battery drain to fast
build quality and ms office not available
less battery backup than expected it gives only 2 3 hours back up in normal usage
its a good laptop but we have faced two major issues mic is not working black screen issue during window update
good not bad
perfect for office usenot good for gaming heats up like an oven even at low settings
product is good but flipkart delivery time taken was too worst
this laptop is only for coding and programming
good but not for gaming
all okay but keyboard light not working
its a good laptop but its shows 12th generation but i get 11th generation that is not good for me
look wise good but there is minor issue in speaker sound this not expected from infinix
prafomas is normal this prais
expect battery everything was incrediblebattery be like i can only give backup for 130 hours with battery saving mode
everything is good only battery backup has 1 issue in this laptop
if you are thinking to buy this laptop thenbattery backup is not more than 2 hrs even on power saving mode microsoft office is not there and rest everything is good
it is very good but its logo of laptop peeled off thats very disappointed but overall its very nice 
this order is placed yesterday evening so didnt use it much but the designing is awesome but the service is not so good by the flipkart delivery boy
not bad does the job for money
product performance is quite good built quality is not so goodno internet port have to buy adapter seperately
product delivered by this store got hang on 11th day from purchasing
all good but battery backup not good enough
good products bt battery is not good
awsome at everything tho havent tried any gamesbut without games awesomeoh ya the speaker is not that powerful but it gives its best
it is so much heating but performance is ok very low sound and design is looking good

overall good productbut battery quality verry bad and sound system volume no loud

display touching keyboard frame some times system not working just hold display till power off with direct switch
performance is good fast battery and camera worst also display is not upto the mark it is light weighted but have to handle with care due to plastic build quality review after 15 days

pro 1 great performance with low price 2 built quality is amazing3 processor is good 4 no lag5 you should do everything in this laptopcons 1 heating problem2 battery is drain so fast3 sound quality is not so good
it was ok
good allover but battery is low but performance is good and display is good
laptop is good under 60k is good but screen quality and speaker quality not up to mark there is no base in voice i suggest you to go for lenovo because of camera shutter and good speaker i choose this bcoz of budget and hdd slot msi bravo 15 is amazing but absence of hdd slot thats why i choose this 
honest review if you aare going for this laptop there is a one major problembuild quality of laptop is worse you can even sense when you hold the laptopyeah some peoplemwill say that is gives flexibility and anyother stuff i have been using this laptop since 9months i suggest go for acer or pay more and go for asus best build quality and gives you best look and performancedefinately go for asus
after using for 4 months i can say thatit is affordable gaming is quite brilliant gta 5 or god of war run very smoothly battery have major issue if 80 charge game will be played for 80 minutes not more than it overall it is very fast and easy
if you are looking for solely gaming then go for i5 11 gen its better then ryzen 5600h in terms if gaming i have noticed sudden frame drops while playing gta v and others high end gamesframe drops are rare but yeah you will see some jitters while gamingover all the product is okayish performance is avg battery is kinda low although battery doesnt really matters much the only things really good would be its thermals i would suggest u to explore other options as there are better
ssd ram is not brandedhynix ram ssd is installed in it other wise the laptop is good if you just upgrade to good ssd and ram
not bad not bad
battery backup is very lessit can run only 3 hours where as it is shown 6 hrs
everything is good except its trackpad
not good for gaming quick heat up and annoying fan noice affecting the gaming purposes good for editing and multitasking very average battery life average display
cant control fan speed heating too much performance good
its a okayish product
gaming wise ok battery backup very bad
battery performance is a big issue in this laptop model normal usage is consuming so much battery power when i have not played a single only giving 25 hrs backupi would say for a new laptop its very low overall laptop is okay hp should work on its battery 
good laptopbut one problem the wifi speed is too low the same internet when connected to my other laptops and mobile iam getting good speed but i have to sit near to the modem for good speed
ok for value of money for designing it works little slow
everything is good touchpad is making noise when touched battery is average
overall performance is good but battery backup is quit low giving 25 hours battery backup but i seen a heating of laptop is quick after 12 hour use 
product is okay but price is heigh
okay product
overall average
ok

if you want to code simple software runs smoothly and when you just open emulator on this if you want to code for react native project then please go for higher ram android development will not work smooth on it some time hang also while to develop react native apps

goodafter four month of usage system perfomence good but battery backup is not good even u dont play games and only use it for internet browsing and some lite work u can have at most 35 hrs and its build material is very very poor plstick it will brake very easily if u dont handle it very carefully otherwise 40k will go up in scraps so before buy it think carefully
not bad

pros good configurations in budget cons delicate design keyboard and trackpad are just okay okay

all the performance is best but in game it show blue display error
laptop is goodif your primary focus is gaming only then buy this laptopdont expect you can rome around with this laptop thinking you will use it on battery
ok
the performance was good no complaints about it the only con is the poor battery life the laptop barely sustained for 3hrs with normal usage from being 100 charge i hope these issue might gets fixed in the future
great performance and a real value for money pproduct if you want a gaming beast under 60k then you should consider this i am satisfied with this purchase but just want to know about its services because i heard msi have bad service quality after purchase just one sugesstion dont use google chrome because it will impact your gaming experience i know you all will think what am saying but in my case suddenly chrome started using high cpu and using cpu full potentiol and then games start lagging
best laptop but only problem is battery backup

the laptop is fabulous highly recommendedmy personal opinion1 the performance is awesome would be more better with 16 gb ram but i dont have any problem because the ram is upgradable 2 the battery backup is not good enough for multimedia and movie watchers since it is a gaming laptop so you may not expect more than 5 hours on movies and multimedia but i think since it is a gaming laptop the battery backup is good enoughsince anybody is not gonna play games on the battery3t

the biggest issue is with the design of the laptop itselfhot air out issueheat flow is directly on the screen which is going to have a bad impact soon enoughduring heavy graphics works like gaming and stuff the laptop heats a lot and releases very hot air directly on the screen and the temperature on that area of screen goes very highkeyboard design issuekeyboard layout is not good toonumpad is just adjusted there looks like it doesnt belong in therepower button is simil
if u want to buy a laptop based on editinggaming i suggest is to please avoid thisall because of its display tft lcd display you cant experience the good quality picturei agree in processor and gpu you can use it for codingalso run smooth gaming but picture not so goodok ok
delivery was too late they took 15 days for delivery about the device design is good and its performance also good but poor battery performance battery draining very fast

overall not recommended for heavy users the cons over pros are heats a lot even in normal usage the gen 4 ssd provided is way slower than my samsung evo plus frequent bluetooth issues heard same from other acer users within a month keys started giving issues bad quality web cam

worst packaging almost shocking to see laptoo came with noprotection is was jst wrotten laptop box and laptop inside default foam pading aaved the laptop i guess no second box or padding to save the laptop laptop is good though
product is overall super but battery life disappointed
battery was not upto the mark facing error while running some aaa games some update not installing properly best value for money if price drops under 60k
this laptop is very slow hai if you are a graphic designer and want to take it for designing then it is not for you at all it shows not responding many times while photoshop is open and if you work on any software like illustrator if yes then this system is not for you at all and for gaming it is neither very good even if you look at it but it is also good in some things like display is very good sound and design is also very good boot time also 10 15 sec there is more according to me 
the top design at the end is lower than the displaymonitor lid thus when you put inside a tight bag it will put pressure on the display lid rather than the hipwhere aspire is writtenyour display will get catches from the keyboard when you put anything other than laptop in the backpack coz the lid is so weak this is very disappointingbattery backup is very bad even if you are not using graphics it will be drained within 23 hrs and if you do graphic related work then it will be dra
a good laptop but installing linux sucks

when i ordered this laptop the screen turned black the display quality is so poor that my 10 year old laptop has better display quality than this definitely not a robust product very fragile and doesnt satisfy its price dont go for it if you dont want to regret build quality is not upto the mark go for some registered brands
ok laptop but not too goodaverage display 3rd class camera and 2230 hours battery backupperformance ok boot time and response fineok ok for daily use but does not worth for 50 k
this product display quality is very poor
worst product ever after using 1 week suddenly its sounds like cricket mosquitos and also its display quality is so poor
product does not seems to be good in comparison with hp display is below average and keyboard design is not good
not at all good for gaming
i am giving 2 star because of these observations1 battery drain very fast maximum it will come only for 3 hours if you just brouse something if you using some software then hardly it will come for only 1 hour2 very heat as soon as you started working it will heat heavily i am so afraid of it so i stopped using laptop in my lap using as a desktop
bad
when you are using laptop it overheating and charger also over heating
its slim but instant heat in normal used don buy this i hate it because touchpad is very bad 
not even one percent of the sound is coming in its speakernot so good at walking either
battery backup is very very bad
pros great performance boots up in 8 seconds can play most games in high settings the rgb keyboard is a beautiful sight to look at screen looks great with the ips display and 144hz cons battery is poor only lasts 1 hour approx on normal usage the cpu can get around 95 degree while playing games but you can decrease it but using throttlestop also it has bluetooth issuesoverall not recommended better get hp pavilion ryzen 5500h
battery backup very poor
dont buy not good laptop
battery backup is low approx 2 hour
all was good except mouse pad some time clicks not work effectively and seems lag it was not at major level its minor

colors and display not up to the mark not looks like an iosdisplay
display was not good
was using a simple platform to learn python coding and the device froze the device is absolutely new and i wasnt even multitasking also the speakers of this device fall on the negative sideapart from that laptop seems fine for now
cons low brightnesslow sound as compared to asus tuf 15 inchprosprice 4825017 inch
its ok but not good experience
3 main issues with the laptop regarding quality1 keyboard is too soft and not tactile unlike rog2 webcam is just 1mp and really worst quality3 laptop build isnt as expected its just too cheap plastic design could have made it better compared to t430 i love t430 more
every thing is good but my screen is beating up
main plus point is the display and the backlit keyboard faced issue in flickering microphone and speaker not working after 5 days as an online teacher both are very essential for me have requested for replacement hope i will get a good product for the amount i purchasededit i did a factory reset and the laptop is working fine now but the customer service of asus is pathetic
sound and battery life utterly disappoints you
screen is flickering sometimes not happy with the display
sound to much low compared to other brand laptop s
review after 2day used camera quality not goodspeaker also not very goodotherwise good product under this price segment fast speed
when i have bought this laptop plug felt on display but its not that much force that displays has broken there itself
battery is goodperformance is awesomedisplay very goodbut sound speaker not good for high volume listening anything very problematic
product is nice but battery is very bad only in 1 hour battery finishes after full charged and not as much attractive as i thought from internally but we can use it in other features in a nice way
when i buy i dont know about the heating problem when u use it it will continue its heat morebut the design is not good the laptop has a fix on 2 hinges
dont buy
battery backup is not good rest is fine

all good but battery backup to low
keypad key press is not good seems to br low quality
brightness level very low
writing this after using it for few months battery is not so impressive looks like it doesnt last more than 152 hours at this price one expects at least 45 hours of battery backup
build quality is very poor on right hand side of the screen there is a noticeable gap between plastic frame and screen it feels like there is a black line on the screen
everything thing is ok but display can crack easly very bad build quality please carefully open it flexible display panal
battery is draining very fast only after normal use like browsing etc
overall product is good but display settings by default is very bad i had to manually adjust settings to make it useableit has hdd bay i install a hdd in it but hdd data transfer is extremely slow making the use of hdd almost useless
the product has issues when it reaches battery level of 25 it lags plus has hanging issues battery life is less than 3hrs
all over good condition but battery capacity is very bad 
not much impressed
battery backup is very bad also there is heating problem
dont buy this especially from this seller the laptop performance is okay but the mouse pad is very worst alignment
good laptop performance and design is better but only problem in battery backup upto 25 hrs
processor little bit slow
prosgood performance thats itconspoor displaywhy touchpad is not in the center looks oddpoor battery lifei dont think its value for money
getting more sound from laptop after using 2 to 3 hours and heat is more
please dont take this product its clock speed is 130 only its performance is not good i have used just 3 months and got less performance
while copying data from external device to pc drive gets hang
finishing is not good not properly placed on table
not the best looking laptop in this budget since you can get the stunningly slim and lightweight infinix x1 neo and x1 slim but this acer laptop has still got a kind of old school charm to it yes its bulky and feels heavy especially coming from a former dell latitude user but the processor is really good for the price amd ryzen 3 3250u is better than most intel chipsets which you get in laptops under 2530k i ordered it only and only because of the chip and nothing else and thats exac
this products is very good for student and this laptop some lag problem and battery more than 4 hours
some lag
ok ok product under this price keyboard makes lot of loose connection noise
key pad not working and mouse touch pad not working its worst product never seenheavy cast west
display is not good and window 11 not update
poor battery performance even in battery saverreturn policy not applicable for battery issuesother aspects laptop is good
its ok but camera is not ok
laptop is okprocessor is goodweb cam is just ok for meetingsbut display is very worst display viewing angles are worst
battery doesnt last long except that its a good buy for this price
worst product hang freezing panal heating problem sometime mouse pade not working
all over product is good in terms of price build quality and performance but display viewing angle makes it worst will not recommend it because if you cant watch the content clearly then there is no use of it it good to go with acer extends instead of this both are at same priceprosgood built qualitygood performacevalue for moneycons display is bad
keyboard problem
everything is good but display only and low sound issues wile installing apps
flipkart didnt deliver the product at time delayed for 6 days and need to rethink before buying in the future product design and look is meet the expectations but not able to type the keyboard fast
or was like ok ok in all the features but display and colour is not soo good actually we say bad colours it was good for office but not for seeing movies and watching videos and photos colour and display is bad performance was ok
after 15 days gatting heat issue and facing problem on pawer off2 times its no show option of power off
speed and performance gooddisplay averagecamera poor
display is not that good viewing angle brightness and overall video consumption experience is so bad
worst cam qualitydisplay not attractivebattery backup 34 hours
display starter shaking within 30 hours of usages and there is no returnreplace or refund availableupdateafter downgrade back to windows 10 there is huge battery backup issuewindows 11 have major display issues
display is flickeringkeyboard made of low quality materialsome keys make noiseloose fitting
audio problem
no money value
too much heating
go for better version of processor
prosser slow work 
update required in 5 days it is very bad product its brightness is very low
first of all i would like to say about courier service which very poor laptop was delivered after the estimated date framecourier boy was not ready for open box delivery when i denied to receive the order then only he ready for open box deliverynow coming to laptop its battery backup seems to be poor display quality seems like ok ok but not up to the mark secondly what you get in this price rangelook wise it is premium
battery capacity is low 
performance quite low
very poor quality not satisfied
i am dissatisfied with the battery life though its noted to last for eight hours with a full charge it lasts for five hours only
not value for money
lenovo laptop is to slow
poor quality its a normal quality not too good
i was purchased this laptop 2 days back only but getting highspeed fan sound on the display side continuously fan sounddont buy at any cost pleaseafter visiting the technician also issue is same so please dont by at any cost
battery is average and display is also average but performance is good and laptop body also average overall is a average laptop
display has failed in just 19 days never expected such bad quality quality and durability is very important for any product and this is just really bad
got screen bleeding within a month display should have been better
it is all right but some time it get hang basicaly i use it for coding not gaming but still it hang and it doesnt comes with ms office
not as expected
just few days and start hanging
the screen has a gap between the frame and the display tried getting a replacement even the replacement had gap looks like the manufacturing itself is like that when checked with technician they said that it would lead to problem in the long run due to dust accumulation
very noise
laptop has screen blinking issue
monitor screen frame is so delicate and gap between frame and screenno supporting os and driver software provided as back upno free antivirus
screen is becoming blank for 2 seconds for every 10 or 15 minsseems a software bug need to work with acer or thisvery good configuration laptop but screen blank issue seems a known issue need to work on it with customer care
just few days and start hanging
have an issue with the product
only problem is that it s body is catching scratches very easily which makes the new laptop look old
the battery will last only 15 hours 
battery backup is low peformence is ok cant say value for money but its ok
very cheap quality
expect battery everything was incrediblebattery be like i can only give backup for 130 hours with battery saving mode
not bad does the job for money
battery backup issue
everything is good in laptop but one bad part is whenever u give little vibration or shake the whole display start moving installation work is super fast display clearity is superb quite heavy but awesome
battery issue only even though u use it in low configuration still battery lasts for 15 hrsif u can compromise with battery then it will be best in this range
ok but
battery backup was soo soo sooo worst and its draining very fast this laptop always use with plugin socket and sometimes i feel whether i purchased laptop or desktop display also having very low brightness performance was average overall it is a not bad and not good product i think realme laptops are more better than this laptop

nice processor but not for gaming works fine most of the time waiting for its warranty to expire so that i could uninstall windows and install linux
build quality is good screen processor every thing is fine but battery charger is completing very fast hardly 90min battery is getting completed
everything thing is good except sound quality and loudness is very low
it is a gaming laptop but its battery backup is only 3 to 4 hour which is less and i think so this is only a problem which i feel overall it is good laptop for this value this experience i share with you when i used it a month 
battery backup is very poorkeep that in mind before buying

everything is fine except battery backup on normal usage without wifi can be used for 2hr 45 min not more than that i expected atleast 4hr considering its a 7nm u series processor and a 48whr battery a bit disappointedperformance is great i dont play games but video editing and photoshop works smoothly without any lag or heat heat management is pretty goodi think the hinge wont be durable after 2yrs or so sometimes a cracking sound can be heard if heard closelyoverall i

perfect for office usenot good for gaming heats up like an oven even at low settings
product is good but flipkart delivery time taken was too worst
this laptop is only for coding and programming
good but not for gaming
all okay but keyboard light not working

it was ok
good allover but battery is low but performance is good and display is good
laptop is good under 60k is good but screen quality and speaker quality not up to mark there is no base in voice i suggest you to go for lenovo because of camera shutter and good speaker i choose this bcoz of budget and hdd slot msi bravo 15 is amazing but absence of hdd slot thats why i choose this 
honest review if you aare going for this laptop there is a one major problembuild quality of laptop is worse you can even sense when you hold the laptopyeah some peoplemwill say that is gives flexibility and anyother stuff i have been using this laptop since 9months i suggest go for acer or pay more and go for asus best build quality and gives you best look and performancedefinately go for asus
after using for 4 months i can say thatit is affordable gaming is quite brilliant gta 5 or god of war run very smoothly battery have major issue if 80 charge game will be played for 80 minutes not more than it overall it is very fast and easy
if you are looking for solely gaming then go for i5 11 gen its better then ryzen 5600h in terms if gaming i have noticed sudden frame drops while playing gta v and others high end gamesframe drops are rare but yeah you will see some jitters while gamingover all the product is okayish performance is avg battery is kinda low although battery doesnt really matters much the only things really good would be its thermals i would suggest u to explore other options as there are better
ssd ram is not brandedhynix ram ssd is installed in it other wise the laptop is good if you just upgrade to good ssd and ram

laptop is goodif your primary focus is gaming only then buy this laptopdont expect you can rome around with this laptop thinking you will use it on battery
ok
the performance was good no complaints about it the only con is the poor battery life the laptop barely sustained for 3hrs with normal usage from being 100 charge i hope these issue might gets fixed in the future
great performance and a real value for money pproduct if you want a gaming beast under 60k then you should consider this i am satisfied with this purchase but just want to know about its services because i heard msi have bad service quality after purchase just one sugesstion dont use google chrome because it will impact your gaming experience i know you all will think what am saying but in my case suddenly chrome started using high cpu and using cpu full potentiol and then games start lagging
best laptop but only problem is battery backup

the laptop is fabulous highly recommendedmy personal opinion1 the performance is awesome would be more better with 16 gb ram but i dont have any problem because the ram is upgradable 2 the battery backup is not good enough for multimedia and movie watchers since it is a gaming laptop so you may not expect more than 5 hours on movies and multimedia but i think since it is a gaming laptop the battery backup is good enoughsince anybody is not gonna play games on the battery3t

this laptop is very slow hai if you are a graphic designer and want to take it for designing then it is not for you at all it shows not responding many times while photoshop is open and if you work on any software like illustrator if yes then this system is not for you at all and for gaming it is neither very good even if you look at it but it is also good in some things like display is very good sound and design is also very good boot time also 10 15 sec there is more according to me 
the top design at the end is lower than the displaymonitor lid thus when you put inside a tight bag it will put pressure on the display lid rather than the hipwhere aspire is writtenyour display will get catches from the keyboard when you put anything other than laptop in the backpack coz the lid is so weak this is very disappointingbattery backup is very bad even if you are not using graphics it will be drained within 23 hrs and if you do graphic related work then it will be dra

not the best looking laptop in this budget since you can get the stunningly slim and lightweight infinix x1 neo and x1 slim but this acer laptop has still got a kind of old school charm to it yes its bulky and feels heavy especially coming from a former dell latitude user but the processor is really good for the price amd ryzen 3 3250u is better than most intel chipsets which you get in laptops under 2530k i ordered it only and only because of the chip and nothing else and thats exac
